[kenny] we\\'ve got three rookie bots making their battlebots debuts: starchild, horizon and shreddit bro! all looking to prove they belong in this elite field of 50 robots. [chris] and tonight\\'s main event features a pair of icons - already backed into a corner with 0-1 records. - [audience continues cheering] hypershock and whiplash collide in a critical match for both teams. [kenny] that\\'s right. will bales had to literally cut a hole in hypershock to remove jamison go\\'s hammer saw from its gut. and matt vasquez had to completely strip down whiplash after getting dismantled by madcatter. both teams are desperate for a win and will do whatever it takes to avoid falling to 0-2.

[audience cheering] [audience cheering] [chris] welcome back to battlebots! tonight's fight card features a collection of teams making their world championship vii debuts, as well as some fighting for the second time this season. up next, we got a couple of squads who are looking to rebound from 0-1 starts, emulsifier and malice. [audience cheering] and let's start off with the rookie who actually had a very impressive, if non-winning showing against reese ewert and fusion. i thought they were pretty good, first time out. [kenny] absolutely. emulsifier ate some big shots in that first fight but just refused to die. their massive vertical disk never stopped spinning. and even though they came out on the wrong side of a judge's decision, i'd call that a good loss. excited to see them back in the box tonight. malice also sits at 0-1 and i know bunny sauriol is supremely confident in her robot and her team. but even she'll be the first one to tell you, you know, we've gotta take our game to the next level and that would start with a win tonight. [kenny] yeah, before their first match, we said this team has to get some wins or they risk falling out of the field of 50 {\\\\i0} next season. they put up a good fight against lock-jaw, but their weapon did go down again which led to the loss. it's a long season, but the clock is ticking on malice and bunny sauriol to get things figured out. let's see what happens. faruq?

[kenny] well, that's a 55 lb.. drumstick but the key for them will be those 13-inch long forks. they wanna use those to pop up emulsifier and then smack its wedge, instead of its weapon. they know how powerful their opponent's disk is. [audience continues cheering] between malice and i, both of our weapons are pretty nasty. we feel if we go weapon-to-weapon with them we might have a shot at ripping off the teeth on their weapon. my weapon is a solid steel disk. there's appears to be a softer material with steel-insert teeth. our thought is, if we go weapon-to-weapon we can potentially rip the teeth off their main weapon bar and win those exchanges. in terms of how we're going to attack, we are putting the forks on and we intend to keep our forks underneath their wedge, uh, by any means possible. we will not stop. we will literally just keep pushing at them until we can get those forks underneath their weapon. and we are going to go at their wedge until we can destroy it, so then we can rip it off and get to the good parts of his robot.

[kenny] malice just flung up into the air. it looked like the fight was over at that point. you see the frame just completely cracked in half. and it was at this point it looked like emulsifier was gonna win the fight. [chris] yeah, i mean after these back-to-back shots, you\\'re thinking, \"well, there\\'s no way that bunny sauriol\\'s bot would stick around.\" but it was that second shot that did something to emulsifier. [kenny] again, when you have these hard-hitting kinetic weapons in the mix, the damage could go both ways. emulsifier was able to self-right but was frozen in place there at the end. [chris] in years past, this may have been called a double knockout. but the rules this season clearly state that movement of any kind means your robot will not be counted out. malice fit that bill. emulsifier did not. - [audience cheering] - great job, guys! [chris] kenny, i don\\'t know what to say. is there any solace that emulsifier can take even though its record is 0-2? i mean it is shown out its rookie season even though the record doesn\\'t indicate that.

[kenny] absolutely, but who you beat and how you beat them does matter. this was not exactly a quality performance in terms of changing the narrative on this team. they need convincing victories in their final two matches. [chris] all right, coming up, charles guan\\'s overhaul will grapple with one of the most unique designs we\\'ve seen in years. it\\'s a rookie, starchild, and it\\'s a quackpot. what the heck is a quackpot? stick around, and you\\'ll find out. [crowd cheering] [crowd cheering] we are back on battlebots, world championship vii. that is kenny florian. i am chris rose. and you can see, our next two teams are already getting set up in the box. representing grabberbot nation and entering his fifth season, we\\'ve got charles guan and his turquoise terror, overhaul, facing a rookie robot led by the former captain of p1, brandon zalinsky. and get this. brandon\\'s meta breaking new design is allegedly a cross between huge and sawblaze. here\\'s a little more on the origin story of starchild. [brandon] starchild is a vertical spinning thwackbot. a thwackbot is a kind of robot that utilizes the robot\\'s body, not just a weapon, in order to get weapon power. we hit the gas, then we hit the brakes, and the whole center section of the body swings over, and hits our opponent. the inspiration for starchild, if you go all the way back, is mark setrakian\\'s robot called the master from the original battlebots series. [announcer] you can see the master scoring some points now. [brandon] the comparisons to huge are obvious, but i don\\'t really agree with a lot of them. huge kind of points at its opponents, and he just obliterates you. - [announcer] ripped through, i mean it. - [commentator] ohhh! - [announcer] ohhh! - [commentator] ohhh! - [announcer] oh, gosh! - [commentator] uh-oh! [brandon] starchild fights a little bit more like sawblaze would fight, but we\\'re wearing a heavier weapon than sawblaze, and we\\'re running at the same speed. [crowd gasping] starchild requires precision driving and being able to accurately place the weapon on top of your opponent, and when it connects, it\\'s one of, if not the highest kinetic energy top attack robots in the entire event. we have a three-pound, or beetleweight version, of this robot, that\\'s been very successful in local events... [all exclaiming] [announcer] a big shot by brandon zalinsky! [brandon] ...so that\\'s why we decided to scale it up to 250 pounds. we wanted to do something cool, something new, something meta breaking, and something that hopefully would be able to turn the kind of four-wheel drive, vertical spinner meta on its head. [crowd cheering] [chris] kenny, today\\'s fight is brought to you by the word \"thwack.\" [kenny] i love it!

[kenny] well, it\\'ll be interesting to see how much of starchild overhaul can even reach, maybe those spokes on its wheels. but charles does have to like this matchup from an experience standpoint, going up against an untested rookie robot. [robot announcer] blue team, ready? [crowd cheering] [chris] team starchild looking awfully confident. now, we heard brandon say this bot is way different than huge, but help me out here, kenny, because i\\'m seeing a lot of similarities. [kenny] yeah, well, those are tegris wheels, just like the ones huge uses, but the big difference is that weapon. at the end of the tail sits a sawblaze-like hammer saw. now, it is powerful, but it will require incredibly technical driving to line up a shot, stop on a dime, and then, deliver the blow. [crowd cheering] [crowd chanting] fight! fight! fight! fight! fight! fight! fight! fight! fight! fight! fight! fight! fight! fight! fight! fight! fight! fight! fight! fight! fight! fight! [chris] it\\'s grabberbot nation versus thwack thwack city. kenny, let\\'s get weird. [buzzes] let the bot battle begin! starchild pulling itself into overhaul\\'s orbit. whiffs on the first whack, and now overhaul\\'s going right at starchild, trying to grab onto that big old thing. [kenny] charles guan actually got a few points he could latch on to, including starchild\\'s main frame, but those big spikes and the wheel spokes are going to be the primary target, chris. [chris] whoa! brandon zalinsky doing a nice job evading overhaul\\'s forks, for now. - uh-oh! bam! - [kenny] oh! good shot there! - uh-oh, look at this. - [chris] it looks like overhaul\\'s got him. starchild getting no traction with those massive wheels, whipping that tail around, trying to break free, kind of like a wild animal caught in the jaws of a predator. [kenny] he\\'s gonna have to let go after 20 seconds. he\\'s trying to get a suplex going, unable to do it because of those gigantic wheels. [chris] starchild works its way off the screws. we\\'ve seen one big thwack so far, but other than that, overhaul\\'s controlled this match pretty much, kenny. [kenny] yeah, brandon zalinsky\\'s had trouble connecting with that weapon. i\\'d try to lure overhaul into one of the short corners. the less space it has to move, the easier it\\'s going to be to hit it.

[kenny] and chris, i'm not sure if overhaul's right side drive is working. charles guan is doing a good job staying aggressive, but he seems to be driving in circles. [chris] now, there's a good shot! probably the best shot in the match. - [kenny] great shot, and another one. - [chris] uh-oh. well, now overhaul has got starchild, and releases him. ninety to go. starchild's starting to get that weapon dialed in, but overhaul seems unfazed. oh, he's got him again, taking him for a ride, trying to throw him up on those screws. nice work. good control by overhaul. [kenny] yeah, charles guan doing a nice job driving right down his opponent's throat, but in order to rack up more damage points, we'll need to see him pick up a little steam, and then, ram starchild into the sides of the arena. [chris] approaching the minute mark now. - whoa! - [kenny] whoa! [chris chuckling] hey. starchild's slicing up its own artwork. now, staring each other down, and overhaul latches on, and they got him good, kenny. [kenny] hey, there's some great control, huh? [chris] it's looking like a dog with a bone! remember, he can hold him there for 20 seconds, then has to let go. can starchild break free? - oh, look at that! - [kenny] oh! [chris] a little reversal! [kenny] that was beautiful, like two grapplers going at it. a little jujitsu here in the battlebox. [chris] starchild dragging overhaul, and lands another good shot! brandon zalinsky's got about 30 seconds left to rip off a few more thwacks. [kenny] some veteran driving here from charles guan, chris, just suffocating starchild, making it hard for brandon zalinsky to do damage. [chris] under 20 to go. another shot there by starchild, trying to get some points in the waning seconds. now that hundred-pound pulverizer's getting in on the action. - overhaul's been controlling things... - {\\\\i0}[crowd] ten, nine, - eight, seven, six... - [chris]... but we have seen some good thwacks. - in its first fight ever... - [crowd] five, four, - three, two, one... - [chris] ...starchild will go the distance with overhaul. [buzzer buzzes] [kenny] and charles guan won't let go! [chris] and so, this one now goes to the judges. all three are former battlebots participants. they are derek young, lisa winer, and fon davis, scoring on an 11-point system, five points to be awarded for damage, three apiece for aggression and control. [chris] all right, kenny. brandon zalinsky was able to land some thwacks with his complex, new design, starchild, but he had trouble doing it consistently. [kenny] yeah, a lot of swings and misses. clearly, that weapon system on starchild is going to take some time to get dialed in, and while they weren't deadly, i think the handful of shots brandon\",\n",

[chris] the veteran, overhaul, did a really nice job of staying patient, and then striking when the time was right. even took the big boy for a ride. how do you think the judges are gonna break this one down? [kenny] you know, both bots stayed aggressive throughout the match, and probably split that category. starchild was able to successfully attack the top of overhaul, but i thought overhaul executed a very effective strategy, and showed superior control. that may be the difference maker on the scorecards. [chris] a very entertaining and unique matchup. here's faruq with the decision. [crowd cheering] the results from the judges are in. the winner, by unanimous decision, is... overhaul! [all applauding] [chuckles] [chris] wow, charles! how are you guys? how exciting was that for you, to get a w out of the gate that way? [charles] oh, it's very exciting. finally, overhaul's worked three minutes straight in the box. didn't catch on fire. [chuckles] charles, how unwieldy was that fight? very. obviously, starchild is a very large robot. it's like, you know, kind of good practice for fighting huge. we have an idea of how we can approach these kinds of large opponents in the future, but, uh, man! i think it was quite a bit to handle, i gotta say. i could never get a full lift on it, just 'cause it's more than twice the size of my own robot, right? that a way, charles. way to get w number one. - congrats. - thank you. thank you very much. [chuckles] listen, i love it when bot builders come up with some new engineering, and even using some traits - that we've seen before... - right. but you know, it can be a little scary when you try something new. [kenny] absolutely, but this was really the best-case scenario for both teams in terms of matchup. starchild got to road test a wild new design against a nonlethal opponent, and overhaul was able to take advantage of a rookie bot who's still figuring things out. excited to see them in their second fight.

[adam] it\\'s an amazing robot, just insane crushing power. there\\'s basically nothing that can stop it, proving that you don\\'t need to be overt to be successful, and it\\'s beautiful on top of it. i\\'m very envious of their design. uh, what about gruff? i mean, gruff is a hard bot to take out. can a crusher bot like quantum beat gruff in a decision? so i think, you know, when you look at standard configs of both robots, you say, \"oh, well, quantum\\'s just gonna come in and bite them,\" but gruff is running a really interesting setup for this fight. they\\'ve got what they\\'re calling, i think, - the bit, on the front... - [kenny] mmm.

[kenny chuckles] [chris] gruff clearly sparing no expense to keep this new attachment a secret. [kenny] the big reveal. that's the big bit adam was talking about. they want to try and feed that to quantum, stop the tooth, and maybe lift it off the ground. [adam] it's a really interesting adaptation. you don't really need to get below the wedge, you just need to get below their tooth. [crowd cheering] in the blue square, from birmingham, u.k., his name starts with a q, and now, he's coming for you. it's quantum! [all applauding] [chris] james and grant cooper. we saw quantum run with two teeth in their win over captain shrederator. what do you think about the choice to just go one tooth today, adam wrigley? [adam] well, that single tooth is gonna concentrate that energy. that's gonna make that bite twice as powerful as when they use two teeth, and they told me they're gonna try and aim for some of the small holes in the top of gruff, and just sneak it in there, and get into those internals. i think it's a good choice, and it's a really interesting difference in how many adaptations they've made. [crowd cheering] our plan is to not let them even get a chance to bite us. we've got some, basically, bite blockers that should stop them from even being able to get inside the perimeter of our robot, but then, we're adding a bar on our forks that should allow us to basically catch them, and hook their top jaw, and throw them that way. i'm seeing some long attachments they've got floating around. if they're long enough, they can get under our arm, and flip us over before we actually get to reach them, so we're going to make sure we get around the side of him. there's something about the brute force of forcing your teeth into the other robot. it's just... it's disgusting and grotesque, but it feels amazing. once the teeth are inside the other robot, there's nothing they can do then. we know that we're in control, and it's making sure that we don't release that control, and give them the opportunity. [crowd cheering] [robot announcer] robots activate. [crowd cheering] [chris] kenny, i think quantum's even scarier with just one tooth.

[kenny] yeah, its top jaw functions as an articulating arm with a hammer saw type weapon at the end of it. now, matt\\'s robots have always been durable since 2019. kraken has gone the distance in 16 of 18 matches, but they only won five of those which is why kraken 2.0 has a big emphasis on offense. he may have some teething issues but, uh, i\\'m excited to see what it can do. uh, speaking of teething issues, this guy is so old, he might not have any more teeth. - [chuckling] - kidding, john reid. i\\'m basically in your own age class. after missing last season, the 63-year-old is back with what still might be the most powerful hammer bot in the world, beta. and john\\'s brought some new blood with him this time around. [kenny] that\\'s right. the last time we saw beta was inworld championship v and they caught some flak from fans for barely using that weapon that every fan in robot combat wants to see. and that should change this year. new to the team, jason marston who has competed overseas almost exclusively with hammer bots. he\\'s got one job and that\\'s fire the hammer early and often. - yeah, i can\\'t wait to see this one. faruq? - [crowd cheering] in the red square, you don\\'t want to cross this frightening bot. the scariest thing',\n",

[crowd cheering] [chris] you know, kenny, one of the many things i love about team kraken, it is truly a family affair for matt spurk, his entire crew. his wife sara\\'s here and then his two boys, cayden and ethan, and they\\'re gonna operate the weapons controller. there\\'s little ethan to the left with the narwhal. and of course, the newest member of the family, kraken 2.0. [kenny] yeah, and it looks great. you can see that battle axe-looking 13-pound blade there. now, with 22 matches as a team, kraken has never knocked out an opponent. that\\'s the goal this year. in the blue square, it\\'s a british invasion. a hard day\\'s fight, you\\'ll face defeat when he fires up his silver hammer to \"let it be.\" forget holding your hand, he\\'ll hold this to your throat and your death will be almost as embarrassing as the songs ringo wrote. he hates you, yeah, yeah, yeah. it\\'s beta! [crowd cheering] [chris] and here comes john reid, pushing out beta. his crew flanking him, holding some of their other hammerheads. kind of gives you a good idea just how big those suckers are, kenny. [kenny] yeah, it\\'s an absolutely devastating weapon when it\\'s fired. but what made it a top eight robot in the world just a few years ago was its mobility and armor. that huge front wedge makes 75% of the robot impenetrable. kraken will have to get round to the back to do any damage here. we feel like our robot is very versatile. i think our weapon gives us an opportunity to kind of exploit some of the weaknesses of beta. this is an evolved kraken. this isn\\'t the same robot that was the punching bag for the... for the entire field last year. this is a robot that\\'s gonna start punching back. strategy with the kraken is really difficult. nobody\\'s seen it fight before. i mean, hopefully we get them trapped in the corner and we just go beat them, again and again until they... they cry enough. i think our main goal for this season is to beat another robot to a pulp.

[chris] give us some more love! get it! fire it! - yes! - [kenny] oh! - [chris] and again, and again! cracking the kraken! - [buzzer rings] - [chris] beta putting on a show in the final second... - [cayden screaming] - [chris] ...for the judges. - [crowd cheering] [kenny] man, this is not gonna be an easy call. [chris] kenny, both bots took some time getting their weapons dialed in, but it was kraken who really drew first blood. [kenny] yeah, matt spurk landed some quality shots and did a good job taking advantage of beta\\'s mobility issues out there on the battlebots floor. this new version of kraken was designed to dish out damage and that\\'s exactly what it did to start this fight. [chris] but here\\'s where things turned. beta lands a big shot that takes out kraken\\'s weapon. [kenny] yeah, that really evened out the match. a hit like that will score a ton of points in the damage category. and even though beta\\'s hammer was bent sideways, it kept firing. both teams stayed aggressive. maybe a few more control points for kraken but this is going to be a tough one for the judges to score.

[chris] hey, congratulations, john. thank you so much. wow! how fun is it when that hammer's working even when it's got like a bent beak to it? halfway through the fight, we were in deep trouble there. but something freed up, the... the... the shell had been bent by them earlier, it freed up and we just got some drive in there. even with the bent hammer, we got some good hits in there, so... it's good to see the hammer... beta's hammer swinging again. - [crowd cheering] - [chris] john, congratulations. way to win one for the old guys. thank you. [laughing] all right, matt spurk. what did you think of the new offensive-minded kraken? well, we added in a spinner this year and we still went to a judges' decision. - so, i don't know what we're doing wrong. - [all laugh] so, um... no, i... i think, you know, we got new bot gremlins we're trying to work through. we were trying some new tires, i'm not sure they gave us real great grip. uh, we got a lot of things we gotta go back to the pit to kind of tweak and adjust but, overall, really happy with how that robot worked. i can see the potential and the hit potential - that this bot has. - [cayden] mmm-hmm. - and i think it's something we can really build with. - [crowd cheering] awesome. good to have you back, you and the entire family. we'll see you down the road. thanks. - [john] great job. - [matt] that was great. - again, thanks a lot, man. - [chuckles] [chris] all right. well, john reid kept his promise about firing the weapon, and they start off the season with a big win, kenny. [kenny] yeah, and that really gets me excited for their next {\\\\i0} fight against shatter. we know our friend adam wrigley isn't trigger shy. could be an all-time great fight between hammer bots. what'd you think of the version of kraken 2.0? [kenny] i loved it. and part of the beauty of the four-fight season is being able to figure things out. the weapon looks like it could be very effective, and it's got three more fights to really get it dialed in.

[chris] coming up next, two rookie robots go mano a mano as the shreddit bro! steps into the box with horizon. and later tonight, in our high-octane main event, the consummate showman will bales and hypershock will collide with matty vasquez and his swiss army bot whiplash. all that and more next here on battlebots. we are back on battlebots and, kenny, up next, we got a couple of rookie bots making theirworld championship vii debuts as shreddit bro! takes on horizon. and we are just one fight away from our electrifying finale between two of the biggest names in the sport. both looking to rebound from opening fight beatdowns. it's the king of control matty vasquez and whiplash taking on the duke of destruction will bales and hypershock. it should be a good one. let's dive into tonight's main event. [crowd chanting] hypershock! hypershock! our first match against sawblaze... smash and burn! [echoing] burn. burn. of course didn't quite go as planned. [chris] uh-oh. hypershock inverted! [echoing] inverted. inverted. and they did exactly what they needed to do. just stay on us. [kenny and chris] wow! [echoing] whoa! we definitely have one of the hardest schedules this year. we've got sawblaze, whiplash, end game, claw viper. claw viper is not an easy fight anymore. [chris and kenny] ohhh! [will] we just saw them wipe the floor with ominous. we need to have some wins in this schedule, so we at least need a win against whiplash. [faruq] it's whiplash! our match up against madcatter was very tough. - [chris] ohhh! - [kenny] oh! huge hit by madcatter. we just had some issues, like our spinner never really got going in that fight. we ended up taking a ton of damage. - [kenny] no! - [chris] oh, no! that was brutal. they hit very hard, like, i don't know if we've ever been hit that hard before. we have a lot of repairs in the pits. we have a very slim pit crew. my brother, he's not even here the whole season 'cause he's still a student. that is a really tough loss. all we can do is get the robot running as well as we can and just fight as hard as we can. whiplash is a control bot. they're a very good control bot. that's what he's gonna do. for us, we wanna get hits in early. and we wanna tear stuff apart. we... we got most destructive bolt last year. we wanna... [chuckles] we wanna represent for that thing. [kenny] will bales just destroyed everything in his path! my tactic was keep the weapon facing towards our opponent, keep hitting 'em no matter what. upside down, right side up, doesn't matter. just hit 'em.

[laughing] [crowd cheering] [chris] two giant nut contenders staring down a potential 0-2 hole. that is going to be a brawl. but there's a look at our next two competitors getting their first taste of the battlebox. and let's start with shreddit bro! that's a new bot but their captain has been here before. evan arias. he used to have a bot called pain train. only managed one win in six career fights. just couldn't find its footing here in the big leagues. but evan is a world champion in lower weight classes. in fact, he accomplished that on the back of his little three-pound version of shreddit bro! kenny, this might be evan's last gasp here atbattlebots. [kenny] yeah, listen. battlebots is reserved for the best of the best. evan's passion is undeniable but he's talked a big game for years and it is way past time to back it up. he has a lot riding on this scaled up version of his beetleweight design. - looks a lot like his old bot pain train. - [chris] right. um, but he said he really focused on making that weapon durable and effective. whatever it takes to prove he belongs in this elite field of 50. [chris] horizon looks like nothing we've ever seen before. it is engineered by joshua kong. he has been a team member of gigabyte in the past. he's no stranger to, i believe the technical term is, scary spinny things, kenny. [kenny] well, horizon's been getting a lot of love back in the pits. this bot is an engineering marvel. it has two 23-pound horizontal disks at the end of each wing. this is an ambitious design, a beautiful machine. is it effective at a... in a fight? hmm, we'll find out. [crowd cheering] all right. the bots are locked and loaded inside the box. let's get ready for this fight. [robotic voice] red team. ready. [chris] and there he is, shreddit bro! looks cleaner than his old bot, pain train, kenny.

[kenny] horizon hesitant to engage so far. [chris] all right, there\\'s a little pop from shreddit bro! [kenny] josh kong can\\'t afford to be too passive here. no matter how insignificant they may seem, shreddit bro! has landed a few jabs. and that\\'s gonna put it ahead on the scorecards.

[kenny] and for horizon, they have to try and take advantage, see if they can get around the back of shreddit bro! and get something going. i wonder if those forks on shreddit bro! are a little too low to the ground, which is not allowing it to drive the way it wants. [bots crackling] - [kenny] oh, yeah. - [chris] yeah. shreddit bro! is... has done more damage to the floor than its opponent. oh! a quality shot there from horizon! doing some damage to the left back tire of shreddit bro!

[chris] yeah, two bots that will definitely benefit from a guaranteed four-fight qualifying schedule. all right, when we return, it's all about tonight's heavyweight main event. hypershock and whiplash are waiting in the wings preparing to make their way into the arena. you simply do not want to miss it. [audience cheering] [chris] welcome back to the fight capital of the world, las vegas, where we are getting set for tonight's heavyweight main event, featuring 2020 runners-up whiplash and last year's most destructive award winner hypershock. each looking to bounce back from an 0-1 start. they both got knocked out. they're both in dire need of a victory here tonight. let's start with matty vasquez and whiplash. they got taken to the shed by madcatter. we haven't seen that very often. [kenny] yeah, frankly, matt vasquez got outdriven in that first fight, and that cost them. they had to completely strip down the robot and replace its internal parts. matt's brother, jason, has been away at school, too, so the crew's been short-staffed. but few teams have the experience the vasquezes do. they're fourth on the all-time wins list, so you can never count them out. in the meantime, hypershock and will bales coming off their best regular season performance yet. right out of the gate, they get punched in the face by sawblaze a few times out there. how do they rebound tonight? [kenny] well, despite having a hammer saw stuck in their chassis, hypershock had an easier rebuild than whiplash. needed to replace some wheels and add new armor, but i'm really excited to see these two in the box. matt vasquez is all about control and precision. will bales is like a bull in a china shop and i think\",\n",

[chris] now, let's take a look at how these two bots stack up mechanically. what sticks out to you, kenny? [kenny] well, both robots have incredibly powerful drive trains, which is just one of the reasons this fight should be so dynamic. but you can see hypershock is the more powerful, more robust robot in every other category. and that puts all the pressure on matt vasquez to be absolutely perfect. [chris] one other thing i didn't mention. they have exactly the same personality as captains, right? will bales, matty vasquez... i'm lying! you'll see it in the tunnel walk. faruq!

              " \"on, man. i snuck into her suite. i-i hid in her closet, and then she dies? how's that gonna look on my resume? like premeditated murder. you know anybody who wants to buy a robot guy franchise? so that's it? robot-man-closet-stalker guy gets his package grabbed and a tv star dies? it is the classic story. you wanted to see us, doc? yeah. i was disposing of annabelle's medical waste, and i noticed something strange. with hematomas, there's almost always some fibrous tissue, but the blood in her brain never clotted. she was an alcoholic. true, but the show required a physical every six months for insurance purposes, so i went through her medical records. clotting function was normal, even at the height of her alcoholism. so no hemophilia, either. nope. (thick southern accent): what we have here is failure to coagulate. her blood tested positive for hemadin with an inr of 4.0. that's slightly higher than clinical levels. are you sure that there's no other reason why she might have been taking blood thinners? uh, she had ulcers. blood thinner would never be prescribed. stokes: hemadin's not really a recreational drug. how'd it get into her system? i retested all the food and drink in her suite, and there was hemadin in her vodka-filled mouthwash bottle. so somebody was poisoning her. yeah, somebody who knew she was doing more than swishing her mouthwash. if annabelle hadn't have had these high levels of hemadin in her blood, could she still be alive? well, her head injury was serious. but i'd have to say the blood thinner in her system could well have been the difference between her living and dying. so the clot doesn't thicken, but the plot does. get this. l.a. coroner's office called. there was hemadin in natasha's system as well. probably from drinking bud's tainted vodka. so annabelle and natasha were ingesting the same poison. other than bud, who knew annabelle was drinking her mouthwash? i know who. brass: working late? no. just saying good-bye to a wonderful part of my past. we'd like to talk to you. megan: oh, of course. about what? grissom: hemadin, among other things. megan: oh, a miracle drug. it's what kept binky alive. well... until yesterday. it also killed annabelle and natasha. really? how odd. we checked with your vet. he said you ordered extra refills of hemadin because your dog kept spitting it out? yes. fussy, silly, sad little binky. oh, i miss him so. not annabelle? not so much. take a look at this, will you? honey, why don't you take ten and go get minty fresh. i think i will. thanks. director: cut! and action... minty fresh. you knew about the alcohol in annabelle's mouthwash, and she knew you knew about it. but what she didn't know is that you were spiking it with your dog's blood thinners. bravo, gentlemen. you should register that, because around here, the walls have ears. that's going to end up in somebody's\",\n",

(laughs) that was my stepping stone for my business. - a datsun? - i sold it for 600 pounds, and i opened my first business with 600 pounds. and that was the datsun that helped me get there. - kahn, how much is this car worth? - well, they cost brand new just over 1.2, 1.3 million pounds, so... - wow. - this, you couldn't put a value on, because it's got my registration number on it, so if you looked at the whole package, it'd probably be most expensive bugatti in the world. - really? - yeah. - [idris] do you know how many miles per gallon it does? - [afzal] i think, i believe it's about six miles to gallon.

(engines revving) you know, until we make a car that as fast as a jet plane, and the jet plane is as fast as a rocket, how could we ever satisfy what our fascination with speed is, you know? i think it's just that continuous exploration, you know? but, you know, i'm 41 now, and i'm still, still, wanna get into more cars, still haven't driven enough, you know? (engines revving) learning how to do this might help with my cornering.

(laughs) (tires screeching) - it's amazing how the urban landscape has created drifting. but the japanese weren't the first to develop a motorsport based on their surroundings. back in the '60s, a group of bikers assembled here at the ace cafe where they planned a deadly bike race around the center of london that would become a phenomenon. i'm here to meet paul dunstall, who was a key member of the movement. - there were no speed limits. only in town was there a speed limit. the cafes were just incidental, really. was just somewhere to... - okay, just a meeting point. - we'd nip into johnson's cafe, pass out a cup of tea, but not for long, and we'd be outside on the out ramp onto the road, sitting there on our bikes, ticking over, ready to go, looking for a motorcycle to go by that looks like he might be... - he might be up for it. - up for a race. (laughs) - it's boy racing, really, wasn't it? - [paul] yeah. - it strikes me that the cafe races wanted to experience the thrill of speed at all costs. the aim was to hit a hundred miles per hour on the streets of london. it was known as the ton up, and those riders that managed it were legendary. - not many bikes would do that in those days. i've got a bike that did a ton, that was quite something. i mean, that quickly moved on in, well, certainly now, so 120 became the, then 125 you needed to do. so i modify a bit of a time, try this, try that, within about of a year, i mean, i'd\",\n",

(engines revving) it's no wonder that drag cars regularly make it into the record books. - [narrator] there they go. - [idris] in the '50s, illegal street racing was out of control. by the end of the decade, it had killed dozens of drivers and spectators. a man called wally parks created the government-backed national hot rod association to take racing off the streets. - [narrator] here they compete under strict rules designed for safety and fair play. automatic expulsion faces any member who races on the public highways. as a result, the juvenile nuisance problem has been reduced as much as 90% in some communities. - [idris] tonight is a practice night where anyone can tune and test their cars. these rides are worth anything from a few thousand to a half a million dollars. they call this grudge racing, personal battles between racers, often with big money bets attached. showing me around is justin humphreys, illegal street racer turned professional. - this is something that, i mean, it happens everywhere. i mean, all local drag strips always have a test and tune night for people just to bring their stuff out, so. - i wanna race. i've got a coach. i wanna use my coach to come race. (engine roaring) (engines roaring) betting on these guys is a serious business, so they ask the organizers to keep their practice times a secret. - [idris] and the man to beat at the moment is this guy, jason. - word? - yeah. - [idris] what's his fastest time? (laughs) - but he's gotta be eight seconds, somewhere, isn't it? - what? - way faster than that. - wow. - yeah. - [idris] it's really easy to see why racers spend their hard-earned cash on these cars. this your boy right here? - [idris] well done, king. how you feeling, you all right? for them, it's a way of life. they're addicted to the competition and the banter that goes with it.

(engine roaring) i wouldn't say that it's necessarily dangerous. i mean, this is the only track i've ever crashed at in my life. i hit the wall at the finish line, 190, 200-mile an hour, and i was out on my phone, on my cellphone talking to my pregnant wife before the emts even got to me, so. i mean, yeah, all motorsports are dangerous, anything can happen at any time. unfortunately, this racetrack has taken the lives of two of our top fuel drivers within the past four or five years, but, hey, that's the risk you take when you go racing. - yeah. (engine roaring) according to some sources, drag racing has killed over 400 drivers since 1950. even with rules and regulation, it's still extremely dangerous. it's no surprise that, over the years, we've attempted to balance the thrill of the car's raw power with our own safety. in the '60s, over 30,000 people a year were killed in road traffic accidents. the us government was soon under pressure to act. cars like the chevrolet corvair were produced with anything but safety in mind. this great-looking motor was a deathtrap to anyone unlucky enough to crash in it. it wasn't long before a protest movement against the car emerged, led by a campaigner called ralph nader. - if general motors wishes to know why i spent an inordinate amount of time on the corvair, it is because the corvair is an inordinately dangerous vehicle. - nader wanted to introduce safety tests and lower the interstate speed limits from 70 to 55.\",\n",

[baby cooing] what are you doing right now? - i'm going to pay my loans. i just got notice that they're due. - that's patty. like all of us, patty has made a lot of decisions in life, and maybe not all of them showed great judgment. but deciding to become a psychologist to help veterans with ptsd seemed like a good one. - with graduate school, i thought, i'm going to graduate and be a doctor. i'll get a good job and make a lot of money and pay those off in no time. but i didn't understand that pretty much every penny i earned was going to be going to my student loans. i feel like i'm never going to catch up. - with four separate loans, our total payment each month was nearly $2,000. but this isn't just about the numbers. - the loan companies are certainly evil and, you know, pull things all the time. like, i was getting messages saying that i was delinquent in a student loan, and i wasn't. they make it really confusing. like, every month, i have to read everything really thoroughly because i'm always suspicious that there's going to be some sort of hidden fee. - this whole system seemed really sketchy. - i feel like one of the lucky ones because i'm able to make my payments. but for some people with busier or harder lives than we have, it's so much worse. - eventually, patty had to leave the va hospital and go into private practice just so we could keep up with the payments. - and it'll affect all of our kids, you know? none of us are saving for our kids' futures. you know, i thought about like, maybe it wasn't a great idea to have him. but i don't know. fuck it. he's really cute. right? - and we're lucky. we have good jobs and so many advantages in life. - get some scholarships, kid. - but what about the 45 million other americans with student debt? the news coverage was not encouraging. - student loan debt\",\n",

              " \"- okay. but do you believe in bankruptcy in general, just as a general-- - sure. - i mean, it sounds like you-- - sure. i do. no. i believe in bankruptcy as a general provision for people who really get hammered, give them a chance to start over. - right. look, we have pretty much dischargeability for bankruptcy for almost any debt you could have. you and i can go to vegas tonight, and maybe we should, lose $10 million, and then we have a chance to discharge it through bankruptcy. the one exception is people with student loan debt struggling as a result of that. and so are you sympathetic to the point that these students have been singled out? - well, i guess one could look at it in that fashion. but you also don't want something-- i mean, you mentioned the borrowers. most of those are repaying their debt. and they're doing so, not comfortably, nobody is-- - they're struggling. yeah, a lot of them are struggling. - they're struggling, at least in their own mind, they're struggling. [dramatic musical sting] and--but most of them are repaying their debt. default rates are higher than they've been, but they still aren't terribly high, and-- - i think--sorry to interject, but i think it is possible for someone to have a tremendous amount of debt, not default, and still be struggling as a result of that. and for what it's worth, tuition, as you well know, is triple what it was back then, but wages have stagnated. does that interest you at all? - yes, but not convincingly. - look, these people are paying their loans well into their 20s, 30s, and 40s, often even into their 50s right now. they're not buying homes as a result. they're buying cars later. they're starting families later. and powell, the fed reserve chair said there could be some macroeconomic problems that occur as a result of that. so do you think it's working? - i think it's--yeah. i mean, you've got 44 million borrowers. [inquisitive music] and so i think it works. - i had met the man behind the bankruptcy rule, and he was not backing down. - i still believe that the-- the right incentive is to say, there's a safeguard here. but you have a major responsibility to repay your loan. - for the next hour, he offered a range of opinions to support his position. - my daughter paid off her entire student loan. she was able--and she was in the income contingent program because her dad knew about it. - not everyone has you for a dad. a lot of people don't know about it. - i mean, we have an awful lot of students who are in never-never land today. but on average, their debt isn't all that substantial. - he concluded with a final thought that encapsulated his position more than anything else-- - for the ones who put themselves in exceptional debt,\",\n",

[upbeat percussive music] - you guys were told, this is what you need to do to get ahead. and if you do it though, oh, actually, you\\'re not ahead. how does that make you feel that that promise is false? - well, the promise is false, but the solution is true. - okay. - for sure. -',\n",

[phone buzzes] it's dixon. we need to get back to the crime scene. what's up? alexander's daughter just got there. she says something is missing from his brownstone. i'm not the kind of person who can just sit around and wallow, so i figured i'd start putting together the outfit my father would want to be buried in. that's when i discovered it was missing. you're saying it was a medal.\",\n",

(fanfare) then in 1915, the image of the ku klux klan was seared into the nation\\'s consciousness by the first true blockbuster in american cinema: d.w. griffith\\'s three-hour epic the birth of a nation. based on a bestselling novel, the movie portrayed klan violence as justifiable and necessary to restore order to a south in chaos... while celebrating klan efforts to keep blacks from exercising their newly granted right to vote. potok: this film so romanticized the klan that the klan pictured itself and described itself as heroically standing up for the oppressed white people, the dispossessed white people of the south. narrator: the birth of a nation sparked a revival of the ku klux klan in the 1920s. the klan\\'s ideology of white supremacy and what they called \"100% americanism\" resonated across the country. potok: the klan of the 1920s was not a rural klan, which the klan of reconstruction had primarily been. the klan of the 1920s was very big in surprising places, places like denver, like portland, detroit, which had huge waves of immigration both of catholics from europe and of african americans coming from the south. narrator: in 1925, 50,000 klansmen and women gathered in washington in a vivid display of their numbers. four million americans claimed klan membership. sims: that particular klan also became very, very powerful politically. they elected at least ten governors. and there were all sorts of public officials who were elected by power of the klan. cunningham: the klan has a great',\n",

(cheering) frierson: you have governors like george wallace openly advocating segregation, openly taking the position that the klan might have taken in that state. in north carolina, we didn't have that. narrator: bob jones feared that north carolina's leaders would not resist the push for integration. in the summer of 1963, he petitioned the united klans of america for a charter to organize in his home state. everybody in this country is organized with the exception of the white protestant gentile. your niggers have your naacp and core, you've got b'nai b'rith for your jewish people, your knights of columbus, which is a secret fraternal order. but the white protestant gentile, the only hope and the only salvation that they have left in this united states today is the united klans of america incorporated. we've saved the south twice, or the klan has, and it looks like we're going to have to do it again. sanders: it was a time when poor white people found themselves in a real strange space because they saw black people progressing and they saw themselves not being paid any attention to. and wealthier white people looked down on them. i mean, they really did. it was all about not being at the bottom of the barrel. narrator: on august 17, jones was chosen to be their first grand dragon. sims: that was the biggest thing in his life. it's probably the biggest thing that ever happened to him. i mean, this was like his birthday. cunningham: bob jones's father was a klan member in the 1920s. he would say that his mother proudly marched in a klan parade when she was seven months pregnant with bob. so he sort\",\n",

(singing \"we shall overcome\") narrator: just 11 days later, the march on washington displayed the growing strength of the civil rights movement. martin luther king, jr: we will be able to speed up that day when all of god\\'s children, black men and white men, jews and gentiles, protestants and catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old negro spiritual, \"free at last, free at last, thank god almighty, we are free at last!\" (cheering) narrator: \"we have the same right as the negro to demonstrate,\" jones declared. on august 31, he held a rally in a cornfield near his hometown, hoping to attract a few hundred people. 2,000 showed up. sims: these people were so afraid that they were going to have even less than what they already had because the black man was going to take their rights. and civil rights workers were starting to come down south, and so some of these people felt they were being invaded. emotions ran high. frierson: bob jones realized, \"we can take this show on the road. we can grow this business that we\\'ve got.\" \"we can travel across the state and present this message all over.\" (fast banjo music playing) radio announcer: well, good morning again. welcome to another country pal show, featuring skeeter live on the banjo. and of course being sponsored by the united klans of america, post office box 321, granite quarry, north carolina. narrator: that fall, jones threw himself into a massive recruiting campaign. criss-crossing the state in his old plymouth, he established local chapters, called klaverns, in every corner of north carolina, signing up hundreds of new members. one of the recruits was a house painter and ordained baptist minister named george dorsett. frierson: dorsett\\'s dad was a klansman. when he was seven years old, his father burned a cross in dorsett\\'s back yard. i mean, i think he wanted to bring his kids into the fold, and he did a good job with dorsett. narrator: dorsett would soon become the klan\\'s official chaplain, or imperial klud, preaching at nearly every rally in the state. frierson: george dorsett is deeply religious and saw becoming a preacher as a way to better himself. he started off with benches and a tent. and then if you\\'re good at it, you want to move up... you want to have a bigger congregation, you want to have a bigger church. he becomes a preacher. he becomes a preacher in the klan. you know, george is always ambitious, i think. narrator:',\n",

(the andy griffith show theme song playing) narrator: one of the most popular television shows of 1963 was set in north carolina in the fictional town of mayberry. oh, you did do all right! sure, three trout and two perch. yeah, together with what me and opie got, we can have a fine fish fry! freeze: mayberry itself was a metaphor of what north carolina had thought of itself for an entire generation. hi, aunt bee. hi, andy! freeze: north carolina always saw itself as a network of small communities ruled by the andy taylors of the world...

(canned laughter) freeze: mayberry is a town that has no racial issues. black people walk around and are part of the community, but they never speak up and disrupt. that\\'s what north carolinians saw as the kind of race relations they wanted. \"you\\'re sorted and you\\'re identified, but don\\'t rattle that system.\" narrator: in the 1960s, however, the world of mayberry was slipping away. north carolina had become the shining light of what was called \"the new south,\" a region that was growing and moving out of the shadow of its tense racial past. state leaders navigated a middle path through the changing racial landscape. they called it \"the north carolina way.\" cunningham: this was a sense that north carolina is a place that, through the goodwill of its people, is going to be willing to gradually change and transform its system of race relations. not that there would be a law passed and the change would have to happen tomorrow. freeze: north carolina\\'s moderate self-image in terms of race relations is based upon along, sustained effort in the 20th century to be more progressive than the rest of the south, not to change the basic dynamics of race relations, but to pursue them in a moderate form that isn\\'t particularly confrontational. narrator: gradual change wasn\\'t acceptable to staunch segregationists or civil rights activists. and as the 1960s progressed, blacks intensified their demands for equality. sanders: i remember late at night sometimes at my house, we would be awakened with my father cursing white people out. but that\\'s what he did in his sleep. he had so much bottled up into him that he had gone through and taken. but getting into the \\'60s, around \\'64, the civil rights',\n",
              " 'at night sometimes at my house, we would be awakened with my father cursing white people out. but that\\'s what he did in his sleep. he had so much bottled up into him that he had gone through and taken. but getting into the \\'60s, around \\'64, the civil rights movement is now beginning to really rev up. you\\'re seeing more political power. you\\'re seeing blacks pursuing public office. white people are having to say, \"they\\'re going to run for office? \"we\\'re going to have a black councilman? you know, that possibility exists?\" cunningham: so in north carolina, you knew if you were a white citizen who wanted to maintain segregation, you couldn\\'t count on your political leadership. and so the klan steps in and says, \"we are the only organization that will support white people in north carolina.\" what bob jones would be talking about are these people who lived a very traditional way of life in predominantly rural areas that were being left out of this whole discourse about the new south. (fiddle playing) narrator: in the summer of 1964, bob jones held scores of rallies, open to whites only, across north carolina. people of all ages gathered in cow pastures and corn fields. sims: for many of these people, it was a family gathering, a source of entertainment, a night out. there would be music playing. david cecelski: they\\'d sell hot dogs, they would raffle off ponies, they\\'d cook a pig. most rallies might only have 20 klansmen, but they could have hundreds or thousands of people that were there, watching and supporting. cunningham: bob jones was really a master at framing the klan as being a lot of things to a lot of people. so for some people, these would be events like county fairs. men who might join the klan would come out with their wives, their kids, their friends. and this was seen as a social event as well as a political event and spectacle. frierson: if you think about, you\\'re living in a small town in rural north carolina and people come up and post fliers, \"there\\'s going to be a klan rally \"down the road here on friday night. \"there\\'s going to be a band playing, \"there\\'s going to be preaching, \"we\\'re going to rail against lyndon johnson, we\\'re going to bum a 60-foot cross.\" i mean, that\\'s an attraction to people in a small town. there\\'s not that much going on, right? narrator: as darkness fell, the tone of the rallies darkened as well. the band gave way to speakers. man: we\\'d like to bring up this little lady who\\'s spoken all over the state... narrator: sybil jones, bob jones\\'s wife and a leader in the klan\\'s ladies auxiliary, cautioned the crowd against inaction. man: mrs. sybil jones. give her a hand, if you will.

(applause) narrator: klan chaplain george dorsett took the microphone next. george dorsett: let me tell you from the platform tonight that big daddy-o and his cheap, sinful integration plan will never overcome! hear me tonight! hear me! (crowd cheering) the prophets in the bible have called integration \"transgression,\" \"abomination,\" \"evil\"! frierson: he knew how to light people up and push the right buttons. these are religious people to begin with. they already know desegregation\\'s bad. it\\'s a threat. and here\\'s somebody who\\'s justifying it in the bible. that\\'s a compelling message for people. freeze: klan rallies in the \\'60s look just like tent revivals of the 1930s. just as the old tent revivalist had helped you gird up your loins against the devil, the klan just reinvented the devil. dorsett: upon your hearts, your conscience... narrator: dorsett\\'s fire-and-brimstone style electrified the crowd. donations poured in. there might be a businessman that\\'s prosperous, and you can afford to give $1,000. you can afford to pay one of the men\\'s salaries to do nothing but set up units throughout north carolina. frierson: it\\'s expressing many of the same ideas that they have. it may not be acceptable in their community to be so overtly racist, but to hear dorsett being overtly racist, he\\'s a stand-in for them. he\\'s saying things they think, but they can\\'t say. and he\\'s going to fire people up to give money and build the group. dorsett: are there others? whatever you haveâ\\x80\\x94 ten dollars, five dollars. walk down with it, will you do that? we\\'re going to count this. (crowd cheering) (piano playing) narrator: a popular hymn, \"the old rugged cross,\" announced each rally\\'s dramatic conclusion: the lighting of a wooden cross, wrapped in burlap and soaked with gasoline. bathed in its warm glow, members and supporters shared a sense of holy mission. cline: jones was offering a chance to be above somebody else, to be better than somebody else. nobody else was taking this approach to talking to people. they were people just like he was who\\'d grown up poor, low skills, low pay, little education, and not much hope of ever bettering themselves. and he convinced them that if they somehow became klan members and stuck together, that they could better themselves and keep other people from',\n",

(chanting): for my country... narrator: for some, a rally was transformative, inspiring them to apply for klan membership. (saying \"pledge of allegiance\") if approved by a klavern\\'s leaders, they were called to a secret initiation ceremony. man: right face, ho! c.p. ellis: i will never forget the night that i was initiated into the klan. man: are you a native-born white, gentile, american citizen? yes. ellis: that was one of the most exciting and thrilling moments of my life. and we shall ever be true to the faithful maintenance of white supremacy... ellis: i had suffered like hell trying to survive financially and try to have some kind of status or standing in the community, and i never could get it. i beseech you, therefore, brethren... but here i was before a whole group of people, and they told me to kneel before the fiery cross. i\\'ll never forget that man saying, \"i now bestow upon you the title of klansman. you\\'ll never be alone anymore.\" and i was absolutely in tears, i was so happy. i was certainly under the impression then that the klan would be better than what i had. and when i first went into it, it was better than what i had. narrator: by the summer of 1965, two years into his term as grand dragon, bob jones had seen his north carolina klan grow to nearly 10,000 dues-paying members. he dreamed of turning the group into a powerful voting bloc. \"i am not advocating violence in any form,\" he said. \"i am asking you as white men to organize now \"so that no politician can be elected to any office without our support.\" cunningham: jones sees the klan as a group that can be an electoral force. and in a lot of ways, that harked back to his romanticized view of what the klan did in the 1920s. this is a group that could represent what he saw as real white people in north carolina. sims: the rank and file looked up to him. he was a hero to them. here all his life, he had just been this little cog in the wheel, and he was grand dragon. he was a big man. narrator: jones used street walksâ\\x80\\x94 daytime marches down main streets of north carolina towns... to show that his klan had nothing to hide. cunningham: their overt goal with these street walks is to really show that they have this human side. but of course, marching down a sidewalk where people had to move aside, this was something that deeply resonated with the racial order in the south. who could claim public space? freeze: respectable people didn\\'t',\n",

(thunder) a big black cloud roll in, and it\\'s raining like mad. (rain pouring) i don\\'t think we even had a forecast for rain for that day. you couldn\\'t see 50 foot in front of you, it was raining so hard. and then everybody dispersed. cunningham: in north carolina, violence, intimidation and terrorism didn\\'t take as pronounced a form as it did in places like mississippi and alabama and georgia. so it was relatively easy for politicians of the period to say, \"well, the klan \"is certainly militantly supporting their position, but they\\'re not engaged in sort of the deadly violence\" as we would see in other places during that time. frierson: the klan leadership in north carolina, they knew how to maintain the party line. \"we\\'re not a violent organization. \"we are a fraternal organization with a right to free speech like anybody else.\" on the other hand, you have this faction within it that you can keep at arm\\'s length, maintain your sort of respectability, and at the same time, have folks that you can wink, wink, nod, nod, go out and intimidate people. narrator: the north carolina klan\\'s favorite form of intimidation was cross burning: in neighborhoods, in front of public buildings, even on the lawn of the governor\\'s mansion. jones and his fellow klansmen didn\\'t see much risk in such actions. even some fbi agents believed that cross burnings didn\\'t hurt',\n",

(crowd cheering) narrator: when the cbs report aired, millions of americans saw the ku klux klan up close for the first time. cunningham: the carolina klan had found themselves relatively insulated from the deadly acts of violence that had really dogged the klan in the deeper south. but when their members are celebrating those acts as politically necessary, it in effect would condone murder in the name of white supremacy. the carolina klan becomes painted in a very different light. narrator: dismantling the klan had not been a priority for j. edgar hoover\\'s fbi. for years, agents had been actively trying to disrupt the other side of the civil rights struggle, which hoover saw as part of a communist conspiracy and more dangerous than the kkk. an official counterintelligence program targeting white hate groups was only a few months old, but it soon had jones and his carolina klan in the crosshairs. potok: hoover initially reluctantly, but then fairly wholeheartedly went after the klan and was very successful placing informants in major klan groups, although some of those informants were very scary and violent people themselves. cunningham: klan members saw themselves as patriotic, as anti-communist. they saw the fbi as probably the staunchest defenders of an america that needed to be kept safe from communism. narrator: in north carolina, agent dargan frierson developed several informants within klan circles. frierson: in my dad\\'s own family history, he has people who are resisting the progress of african-american people. so he can go to klan people and say, \"hey, my granddaddy was in the klan, so i know what you\\'re going through.\" the other thing is, you can go to a potential informant and say, \"we\\'re trying to do the same things, right? \"we want to fight communism too. help us do that.\" narrator: none was more valuable than george dorsett, the north carolina klan\\'s biggest fundraiser and one of the most powerful members of jones\\'s inner circle. frierson: dorsett throughout his life thought the klan was a righteous organization. it had a righteous purpose in the world. i asked my dad one time, \"why would dorsett work for you?\" and his answer was, \"because we became friends.\" and the other thing is, once you get somebody to give you information and sign a receipt, my dad always said, \"then you got them, right? because the threat of exposing somebody is real.\" narrator: dorsett',\n",

[sighs] detective, don't be fooled by her sneaky therapist ways. she's trying to trick you into over-analyzing your emotions. and before you know it, you'll be second-guessing your every decision. i say we just do it. - do what? - this. doctor, what is it you desire? i... i wanna protect my child. linda, if someone's trying to hurt charlie, we can help you but how is getting arrested for murder gonna protect him? i think our time is up for today. okay, well, you give me no choice. doctor linda martin, you're under arrest for murder. [theme music playing] [elevator dings] what the hell is going on here? please tell me you don't actually believe linda killed somebody. she confessed, maze. - you killed somebody? - yep. - who? - it was... doesn't matter. it's impulse crime. it was a crime of impulse. my kind of crime. all the best decisions are made in the heat of the moment. [chuckles] hypothetically, of course. and how did you kill them? really good. and hard. all the way dead. - she's lying. - we know. the gun registered to her is a 9mm, ballistics says the murder weapon is a.38. not to mention, it's the doctor. we just don't know why she's lying. i don't either. i was talking to her last night, and... - linda. - zip it, maze. - if you don't te... - nope. - linda, i... - uh-uh. nope. if you don't tell them, i will. wow, quite the secret you've been keeping from us. a biological daughter who doesn't know you exist? - adriana. - and you've been stalking her... more like... keeping an eye on her. - from a distance. - secretly? of course, secretly. a little harmless stalking never killed anyone. okay, um... after maze tracked her down, i told myself to be patient. wait for her to find me, but i... but i couldn't help it. i had to see her. so you just did it. one can definitely understand that. yes, and it's a good thing i did. because even from a distance, i\",\n",

[sighs] i did it. i killed him. why? i'm a realtor. i'd just sold mr. sterling that house. i knew he was going to be out of town. and i knew the combination to his safe. god, it was just supposed to be a simple robbery. nobody was supposed to get hurt. [whimpering] [shuddering breath] but mr. sterling came home before he was supposed to and... and he caught me red-handed. so i shot him. do you have the murder weapon or any of the stolen items? no. i got rid of everything right away. i wasn't going to confess, but the guilt was too much. that's all i have to say. okay. well, we're gonna need a written statement. she didn't do it. i don't know why she's saying this. something feels wrong. hmm. speaking of things that feel wrong, but the exact opposite, the detective and i are together and everything feels right. neither of us holding anything back. no unidentified feelings of unease. - what? - well, any thoughts? you know, on how splendid that is?

[inhales through teeth] [sighs] you know how i left to go find myself? - yeah. - well, i, uh... tried a bunch of stuff, and nothing quite clicked. so i thought back to when i was happiest. do you remember that time we went after that guy on that case together? vaguely. okay, i guess for you it was just another day at the office. but... [groans] for me, it was... different. and challenging and scary. in a good way. anyway, i realized what i had to do to be happy. you know? it was really quite clear. i don't know why it took me so long to realize it. but, um... [smacks lips] i had to become a bounty hunter! 'kay. good luck with that. wait! aren't you going after that clive guy too? we could go after him together. i work alone. please? [sighs] i could learn so much from you. oh, good. you caught me on my mentoring streak. uh, 70-30 split. eighty-twenty? - deal. - [screams] yay! [clears throat] so i, uh, i already checked the place, you know? no real clues as to where he could be, but, um, check this out. it's a hollingshead. his paintings go for hundreds of thousands.

[sighs] i think she's afraid. she took a bad loan, she got mixed up with some sketchy people and... i overheard her fighting on the phone with one of them earlier. do you know... was it, uh, a guy named clive winter? no. no, it was a woman. - jamie. - jamie? okay. well, that gives me enough to work with. thank you so much, gentlemen. - huh. - drinks on the house. - [in hebrew] l'chaim. - hmm.

(knocking at door) michael, come in. i just reviewed operation javelin. solid plan. i think so. finding that airfield was a stroke of luck. built by a dutch mining consortium in the '50s. the key'll be taking it quickly. i don't want to allow any time for opposition to organize. understood. from what i can gather, there's no telling what the situation could be on the ground. that's right. there's a lot of armed tribes out there with no central command. if we have to go in, i want to get in fast and get out fast. about that, do you really think it's advisable for you to jump with the lead element? (chuckles) we're airborne. i believe in leading from the front. so do i. but as you said, this could be a tricky situation. we need you safely on the ground to direct operations, and we both have enough scars to know that night drops can be unpredictable at best. i would hate to explain how we lost a two-star jumping into the jungle in the dark. point taken. i'll land with the planes once they secure the airfield. anything else? i just wish i was going with you. roger that. how is claudia joy? she'll be fine. thanks for asking. our prayers are with you, michael. i appreciate that. am i interrupting? no, of course not.\",\n",

              " \"nothing that we could do about it. this was a theater which we really only had nominal participation in. narrator: america's watching was being done by o.s.s. men. one of them-- lieutenant colonel peter dewey-- especially annoyed the french representative-- colonel cedile-- and general gracey. when gracey and the french representative found out that we were meeting with dewey they were extremely angry. and although they did not say it publicly they showed that they were clearly against the activities of dewey. colonel dewey of the o.s.s. was a law to himself. he had arrived and attached himself to the control commission i think, a little to cedile's surprise as well as gracey's surprise and he was a man who acted, always, on his own. narrator: relations between the o.s.s. men and general gracey deteriorated. after a dispute, gracey suggested, or ordered-- it's not clear which-- that peter dewey leave saigon. on september 26 colonel dewey set out with his friend, captain bluechel in a less-than-clearly-marked jeep. as we were driving along we came to a corner-- we had to turn to the right-- and about 10 yards further down, as we turned we encountered a roadblock-- nothing formidable. but it necessitated for us to make a reverse s to get through. this was alongside the saigon golf course. so, as we were going through the s part of the roadblock we saw three annamese in the ditch to our left. peter shook his fist at them. he yelled something in french. what he said, i don't know because i don't speak french or understand it. at that point, a machine gun opened fire and the burst hit peter dewey right in the head-- in the back of the head. it looked like part of his lower jaw had been shot away and the jeep continued then towards the ditch and it rolled over on its side. the firing continued but the chassis of the jeep protected me. the machine gun burst didn't touch me. just lucky. we tried our best to find out what happened but there was nothing we could do. and the question was whether there was anything we should try to do. because i say that was a case of, really, of just...of a murder rather than a military action. turns out that peter dewey was the first american to be killed in vietnam. captioned by the caption center wgbh boston api.opensubtitles.org is deprecated, please implement rest api from opensubtitles.com\",\n",

i'm evacuating the facility. why? i'll let them explain it to you. officer parkman. mr. petrelli. matt? i thought you were going to find your father. i did. he attacked angela petrelli. my father killed kaito nakamura. he's killing them all. and now he's coming to kill bob. hello! hello! hello! there's no one here, peter. they've all gone. evacuated by homeland security. peter, what did you do? me? i didn't do anything. are you sure? look, we were in montreal. i pick up a note from some guy named adam, who says the world is in danger. next thing i know, we're here. one year in the future? i mean, how's that even possible? on the ground! get on the ground, now! do you have any symptoms? are you sick? are you infected? sick? what the hell is going on? take them to decontamination. now! mom? did you make waffles? nope. west did. i wanted to bring you breakfast. hope you don't mind. why would she mind? because he wasn't invited and some people think that's rude. nonsense. your dad and i love meeting your friends. will mr. butler be joining us? sadly, no. his business trip was extended. something about something i wasn't paying any attention to. lyle! get your butt out of bed! he's adorable! why would you come here when i told you not to? i had to show you something. check it out. we're infamous. drunk cheerleader suspended. claims that she saw a boy fly. what are we gonna do? people are gonna know it was us. how? it's a blurb on the last page of the local flavor section. it's no big. it is big. you can't do whatever you want, whenever you want. i just want to be a part of your life. okay. but just for waffles. how do you know your father's coming to kill bob? isn't this all a bit reactionary? no. matt's right. security just found his car ditched off the road. maury could be here right now. i'm taking you into protective custody. my first priority is to keep you safe. you can't. you couldn't keep angela petrelli safe. she almost killed herself on your watch. no. we stop maury here, now. you realize that makes you the bait. we all have our roles to play. that's what linderman used to say. my mother, too. it's always these half-truths. no straight answers. constant manipulation. i'm trying to help everyone here. how, bob? what the hell did you people do? why is maury coming here to kill you? now is not the time to recount the past, but to focus on the task at hand. all right, fine. so, we stay here. how do we stop my father? dr. suresh, i need you and niki to inject maury with the virus. virus? what virus? the virus takes away abilities. it's also potentially lethal. you said we'd never use it again. circumstances have changed. i will not knowingly spread this virus. maury's a killer. he knows your thoughts, your nightmares, and he could turn your world inside out. we take away his abilities and then you can cure him with the antibodies in your blood. no one dies here today. he's not exactly gonna volunteer for a shot. i can be persuasive. i appreciate the thought, but this one goes to you, matt. what? me? all i can do is read minds. no, no, no. you have the same abilities as maury has. anything the brain controls, you control. no. senses, actions, thoughts... no! no. i can't... i can't do any of that stuff. well, then you'd better learn fast because you're the only one who could stop your father. caitlin! caitlin! caitlin! caitlin! peter petrelli? according to these files, you're a dead man. what? got your death certificate right here. so, you're gonna have to explain to me how does a dead man walk around new york city with no sign of infection? infection? i don't know what you're talking about. where's caitlin? i need to see her. she's from ireland. all foreigners are deported. you can't do that. who the hell are you people? what's going on here? you really don't know? on march 20th, 2007 the first case was reported. after that, the shanti virus spread across the globe, a pandemic. it's killed 93% of the world's population to date. the rest of us live in quarantine praying to find a cure. this can't be happening. i wish it wasn't. all these people died from the virus? yeah, it's been a tough week. i'm supposed to be out hunting down maury, but i needed to see you. i never should've asked you to use your ability to find my dad. you were just trying to make me happy. i know that feeling. when my dad left, i blamed myself. i thought that i was too slow, too fat, too stupid. i thought that if i was better, if i was smarter, he would've stayed. and now they want me... they think that i can stop him, that i have this power. and i don't. i don't. i need you to hear, i need you to know that i love you. did you just hear me? molly. i love you, molly. what's left of the virus is in the lab. each syringe contains only one dose, so use it wisely. you don't trust bob, do you? did he put you up to this? i put me up to this. i want to hear your side. bob is morally gray at best. and the virus? he's toying with a death sentence. you have the cure. no one dies. just because he has a safety net, doesn't make it ethical. so, you would make a different choice? morally un-gray? i killed a lot of people. brutally. ripped them in half. they could've given me the virus. but they didn't. they've made me right so that i could have a life, go home to my son. you're never gonna have a life. you're not cured. you're a killer. and before this day is over, you're going to kill everyone. niki? go on. tell him what you're seeing. he'll think you've gone crazy again. and then you'll never see micah. is everything all right? let's go. i know these other families. linderman. nakamura. pratt. deveaux. everyone who's been killed. but i don't know this one. who is he? who's adam monroe? adam is complicated. so uncomplicate it. adam convinced us that we belonged together, that we can make the world a better place for our children, for you. \\\"snow falls on miami.\\\" i don't get it. that headline could have read, \\\"tsunami wipes out eastern seaboard.\\\" what does any of this have to do with the murders? adam is the one who's trying to kill us. i thought maury parkman was... maury's the weapon. he's the blunt instrument. adam was the visionary. but with these abilities, sometimes people tend to think of themselves as gods. did you ever think that, nathan? adam did. and he began to talk about holocausts, plagues, punishing humanity in order to save the world. sounds a lot like linderman. linderman was adam's disciple. adam was dangerous. so, we locked him up, we threw away the key. two weeks ago, he escapes. and now he wants revenge. it sounds like you're reaping what you sow. why should i care? because of peter. listen, pal, if you want to talk about my brother, you better be very careful what you say next. peter is alive, nathan. your brother's alive. i'll leave you two alone. do i know you? they brought me here to help you, peter. you need to remember who you are. i need to find caitlin. you need to focus. you can move objects with your mind, heal, you can paint the future. how do you know about that? you absorb abilities from other people. you are the most powerful of us all. you're a kind, caring soul. selfless. always thinking about others. but now you need to think about yourself and fly into the face of danger, just like your brother. i have a brother? he died in the first outbreak. but you. you can change that. how? i was in montreal in 2007. next thing i know, i'm here. you met a man named hiro nakamura. he can travel in time. so can you. you can change history. i can't. you must. i can't control these things that are happening to me. then this virus will kill us all. peter, you need to remember. you need to remember. mom? mom. do the marks hurt? no. they're kind of just there. painless souvenirs of my alien abduction from the guy with horn-rimmed glasses. if you're going to be dropping in, there's something i need to tell you. i get it. get what? i'm moving too fast. we don't have to go any further if you don't want to. you know what i want? popsicles. popsicles. awesome. raspberry or blue? he found us. who? the man who abducted me. we've got to get out of here. come on. no. wait. that's what i've been trying to tell you. the guy in the glasses is my father. what is this? some sort of trap? no, just listen to me. back off. wait! claire? who are you talking to? no one. you've got two popsicles. welcome home. all this trouble over one drop of liquid. this virus could kill an entire species. or it could stop maury and save our lives. poor, niki. so strong. so vulnerable. you're perfect. show me your nightmares. show me your thoughts. show me your soul. i'll turn you into a killer. nothing's going to save you. this company is bad. you're not making up for your sins. you're digging deeper into hell, and worse, you're gonna drag micah right down with you! you're wrong. they said that they would help me. niki? what're you talking about? i was sick. i'm still sick. how can you say that? because you're dead. no, i'm not. they don't want me talking to you. they're using you, nik. just like linderman. just like jessica. you can still do the right thing. you have to kill him. it's the only way you can save micah. niki, you're talking to yourself. i think it's maury. we need to call bob. there's many guns in japan. they will crush history. i cannot let white beard win. we can still stop this. together. we did make a good team, you and i. you showed me how to be a hero, how to love. and then you took it all away. do it, hiro. stop time. kill me. cut off my head. i will not do it. i still have faith in you. the honorable hiro nakamura. he won't kill you, he'll just lie, cheat and steal. i wanted to help you become a hero. i never claimed to be anything more than a happy drunk. do not punish the world for my mistakes. i only want to punish you, hiro. yaeko was right. she's not destined to be my princess. she's destined to die. no! take my hand. we must get out of here now. as long as i have breath, anything you love i will lay to waste. i swear. peter's alive, nathan. this was taken three months ago, right here. is he here now? no. he's gone. gone where? what is it you're not telling me? i need to know everything. he was in cork, ireland, and then we lost track of him. lost track of him? how do you lose someone? how do you lose someone? dad! matt! molly? what're you doing in here? where are we? this is where he keeps me. what? when i tried to find your dad, he locked me in here. now we're both trapped. no. no, we're not. dad! dad! matt? did you bring me here? i think i did. stay back, nathan. i got it. don't do it, niki. this isn't you. don't do it. how can you defend him? he killed d.l. i didn't kill anyone. it's maury. he's gotten inside of your head. listen to me, this is a nightmare. this isn't you, okay? don't be his puppet. you're stronger than this. you came here to get control of your life. don't let maury undo all of that. your boy. listen to me. listen to me. think of your son. think of micah. think of your boy. i couldn't get the nightmare out. i didn't know what else to do. i had to stop myself. matt? don't be scared, molly. we're gonna get out of here. do you recognize this room? yeah, of course. this is our old place on parthenia. brisket and potatoes. this is the night you left. i never apologized. you weren't sorry. you walked out that door, you never even turned back. you think this didn't hurt me? this broke my heart. i love you, matt. then turn yourself in. that's not gonna happen. there's no prison that can hold me. i think there is. i think i can trap you in here just like you trapped molly. how're you going to do that? look around, pop. this isn't my nightmare, this is yours. i can walk right out that door. no, you can't. i have to. come on. you can't because you're not strong enough. because you're still that scared little boy. no, i'm not scared of you anymore. i'm a good man, i'm a good cop. i'm a good father, which is something you know nothing about. you don't know what it's like to fight for someone that you love. you left. you left. all you have are your nightmares. let's get out of here. don't leave me. don't leave me alone. no! matt? oh, god. well, the nightmare's over. he's never going to hurt you again. ever, i promise. oh. oh, god. i love you. i heard. so, what happens next? where do all these people go? same place we are, home. peter! peter! caitlin! peter. wait. i'm so scared. please, don't let them take me away from you. okay. i'll get us home. i promise. please, peter. don't let them take me. please. no. no! no! caitlin! the antibodies in my blood will eradicate any traces of the virus in your system. your nose, does it hurt? only when i breathe. i'm sorry. it's not your fault. you weren't in control. this can't be right. what's wrong? the antibodies aren't working. this isn't possible. not now. it's another strain of the virus. it's immune. my blood's no longer a cure. i'm going to die? hiro! this strain has no cure. are you certain of these results? we'll keep maury sedated. we'll destroy every last vial. i promise. what is this? it's a chance to save niki. we got a police report. a girl walks away from a 50-foot fall without a scratch. cellular regeneration? her name is claire bennet. you remember her father? noah. he worked for us. of course. he's not exactly going to let us take his daughter, is he? are you saying we should kill him? i'm saying we should be prepared. this is ivan spector, our man in the ukraine. he was bennet's friend, his mentor. bennet killed him. when was this? last night. are you sure it was him? he left fingerprints. bennet is getting sloppy. emotional. and that means dangerous. i have something i need to tell you. i have been working with bennet to take down this company. why are you telling me this now? because i'm unsure of who's right and who's wrong and it's time to stop playing games. there's a storm coming, dr. suresh. claire is the key. her regenerative abilities, they could cure the virus. she could save niki. i want to do the right thing here. for niki. for everyone. so, did you meet him? meet who? the boyfriend. west. he was here today. claire has a boyfriend? i checked him out. he's fine. you cannot be the only man in her life forever. no, i suppose not. we knew this day would come. you want to tell me about this? it's nothing. nothing? \\\"cheerleader claims she saw her teammate fall 50 feet to her death.\\\" that's nothing? i asked you to do one thing, claire. i asked you to keep your nose clean. debbie was drunk. nobody believes her. did your boyfriend make you do this? are you kidding me? answer me. it's none of your business. your tiny rebellions are putting this family in danger. me? what about you, dad? you think any of us really believe that you were out at a copy conference? where were you, out abducting people? what is going on down here? what did claire do this time? shut up, lyle. it's not safe here anymore. pack your bags. we're moving. you can't do that. this is not a discussion. we're leaving. well, then you're going without me. adam. i don't really know any adam. peter, what the hell was that? do you know me? of course i know you. it's me, adam. don't you remember? you and i are going to change history. support us and become vip member to remove all ads from www.opensubtitles.org\",\n          \"advertise your product or brand here contact www.opensubtitles.org today bad news. he's definitely escaped. and one guard didn't clock out this morning. oh, great. i knew this was gonna end in overtime. thanks, helen. okay, everyone, it's official. i haven't got time to read all that. tell me about peter reece. by all accounts, a model inmate. kept himself to himself. according to the prison governor, reece is intelligent, manipulative and extremely dangerous. sounds like my type of guy. family background?

i was just thinking about us. remembering silly things, like when you made me that go-kart and the wheels fell off. you never let me forget it. you was convinced i was trying to kill ya. i know you'd never do that. this is better than being in that home, isn't it, princess? yeah. but they were really quite good to me. i used to go to the cinema all the time. ah, so you could meet boys there? no! but we'd often end up in this little pub, and i'd have a glass of dry white wine. terribly chic, just like in the films. where we're going, we can spend all day drinking vino, with long siestas in the afternoon. - will it be sunny? - every day of the year. oh, i'll love that. whatever you want, ellie. so you won't have to hurt any more people, will you, peter? i hate that. hey! it's me, peter! not some nutter. right, first things first. the latest... good morning, ma'am! yes, sorry. good morning, everyone. morning. right, what have we got? one escaped psychopath, one torched patrol car and three dead police officers. and now, one missing sister. god knows what he could do to her. you must read this. okay, reece is highly unstable, but i don't think he'll lay a finger on his sister. well, not to harm her, anyway. gets better every minute. do we know what car he's got? well, you know he torched the patrol car that he stole? cut the shit. do we know what car he's driving? no. terrific. so, what else do we have? great. - hey, sweetie. - hi. couldn't find any doritos or twinkies or anything. so, you want some?

he is kinda big. come on. - honey, over here. - coming. ah, don't pay any attention to him. small town, small mentality... big muscles... hey, look at this! hey, don't sound too interested, or i'll think you're starting to enjoy yourself. you know, i thought we bought enough food for the week, but now i'm not so sure. there's plenty of steak in the freezer. cute. very cute. honey, how were they supposed to know you were vegetarian? no! don't put your shoes on the table. - what? - it's bad luck. - who says? - my grandmother. so what are we going to have for dinner? well, when you were buying those tacky little ceramic things for mom and dad, i booked us a quiet little table for two in that restaurant in town. - you didn't? - mm-hmm. sweetheart! there's a lot of things about the guy you married you don't even know yet. yeah? such as? his almost legendary resourcefulness in a crisis. - oh, and what are the others? - i'll think of something. - aw, shit. - hmm?

- when we leave the country. somewhere where it's sunny every day? that's right. somewhere we can be together. just nipping out for a burger. do you want anything? oh, no thanks, helen. i actually made myself some sandwiches today. - cottage cheese and salad. - well done! oh, helen, did you manage to get a recent photograph of elise reece? that one records sent through was no bloody good at all. well, i expect she's changed quite a bit since she was three-and-a-half. yeah. no, i was hoping to get one from the foster home, but it looks like reece got there first. well, when he broke in, he took all her records. he's totally obsessed with his sister. i don't think he'd want anyone even looking at a photo of her. oh, what a sicko. oh, well, keep trying. erm, school snaps, friends... you know the score. - right you are. - oh, and helen? get us a cheeseburger. stuff the diet. megan. what are you doing? hubba-hubba, what a babe. you voyeur! i love when you talk french to me, ma ch\\u00e3\\u00a9rie! - get outta here! - whoo! whoo! hey! hey, look! i'm sorry about this morning. just wanted to say hello to a fellow american. i'm half yankee myself, and... aw, man. i've done it again. what do you want?

you'll end up looking like a giant corncob, honey. thank you! just let me die in peace, please. do you want me to carry you to the door? no! you'd never make it. - bye-bye. - how 'bout a cup of coffee? coffee? you call me a corncob then ask for coffee? it's abuse! what's it gonna be like in twenty-five years? in twenty-five years, i won't have been talking to you for at least ten. i'm never gonna speak to you again, starting right now. oh, all right. i'll park the car. - you're not going to... - ssh. no. they're our passport out of here. i won't hurt them. unless i have to. \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa such a golden man \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa and he said he saw me 'cross the room \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa so i said to... honey, i'm home! you must be byron. as you can see, megan has already been introduced. now the formalities are out of the way, let's get straight to the point. - money on the table. - look... byron, just do as he says. really, byron. i'd listen to your wife. she's makin' a lot of sense. please! we're just on honeymoon and we're... you're nothing! nothing at all. back, byron! or it's bye, ron! when i said you were nothing, that wasn't strictly true. you can be my meal ticket. put 'em on. her as well. come on, honey, chop-chop! let... let my wife go, please. we're on honeymoon... do you think i'm bloody stupid?

you shouldn't ask me these sort of things. i shouldn't tell you, anyway. look, i don't mean you any harm. but peter says the less you know, the better. knowledge is power, or something. i don't really understand. now, this will hurt. you should've seen the state i was in when i crashed my go-kart. - when you were a child? - yeah. that was years ago, but you should've seen the state i was in. did you have to go to the hospital? yep. took them three days to sort me out. but i survived. what are you runnin' from, ellie? nothing! i told you not to ask questions. you'll only try to trick me, and... but i'm not gonna trick you. how old are you, anyway? you shouldn't be here. i'm eighteen. well, nearly. but i tell you, i know more about life than most people my age. yeah, if you hang around with peter, i'm not surprised. i hadn't seen him for five years! it's nothing to do with him. you can't blame everything on him. okay, okay. don't get excited. i'm sorry. aren't you feeling any better? yeah, wonderful. maybe you're right. i should talk to you. you might go into a coma or something, and then i wouldn't know what to do. what do you want to talk about? i don't know. do you like books? yeah. i'm going to own a bookshop. you like reading, then? i love it. in the home, i was good at english and art. an active imagination, that's what they said i had. i was lousy at maths and things like that. do you like any american authors?

you never said it had to be! you asked me my favourite book, and that's what i told you. yeah... well, there's a story like that set around here. there aren't any moors around here. yeah, i know, but there are cliffs. megan's doing a degree in history, and she showed me this story. it's an account of a woman whose life comes to a tragic end. tell me. well, there's a girl. she's about eighteen. and she's engaged to this guy who promises to come back from the crusades and marry her. but he's taken prisoner by the saracens. go on. she waits for years and years, and gets more and more depressed, and, finally, she figures he's dead and she gives up waiting. little does she know that he's just escaped and he's on his way home. well, as he nears the coast, she senses his presence and hears him calling out to her. now, she thinks that the only way to be with him is to kill herself. and she jumps off a cliff. - oh, no. - yeah. anyway, the next day, he comes home, everybody's happy to see him, but they know they have bad news. then what? what does he do? i'll tell you tomorrow. no, that's not fair! i tell you what, tomorrow i'll bandage your leg again, and i'll give you some more pills. okay. well, he's distraught at this news, and he makes his way up to the cliff from which his fianc\\u00e3\\u00a9e had thrown herself. oh, it's like a suicide pact. don't tell me, he throws himself into the sea to be with the one he loves more than life itself. no. on the way, he meets a young, rich widow. they fall in love. he forgets all about jumpin' off the cliff, and two weeks later, they get married. no, he didn't! no, no, that's... that's not romantic. - it never happens like that. - honest. no way! all right. yeah, he jumps off the cliff and dies in a mangled heap on the rocks. satisfied? peter's back. i'm sorry. it'll be our secret. byron. byron, sweetie. are you okay? byron! peter! peter! peter! open the door! he's gonna die! peter! i'm bloody warning you, i've had enough today. goddamn it, he needs help. medical help! i'll just go and get the doctor, shall i?

peter! just call a doctor! i swear i won't say anything. i'll say it was an accident! i don't trust you. please. but then again, if you were to be good to me, i could be good to you. - what do you mean?

- oh, dear... is your honeymoon over? at least you won't forget it, will you? i tell you what, let's give you something to remind you of the wonderful time you've had here. something to show the family. i can't quite get the composition right. oh, yes, that was very good. ever done any modelling, byron? that'll be very realistic. i'm hungry. there's plenty of meat in the freezer. and i'm sure you can rustle up something delicious for us all... meggie. he was in the air force, just across the way. he met mom there, got married, moved back to the states, had kids, got bored, got divorced. i mean, she never got over livin' here. so she bought a place in the village, so she could be back to her roots. and i always stayed. but i will go back to the states one day. i'm always boxin', and that's the place to be. why box, though? it's so cruel. well, i don't know any better, now, do i? anyway, i'm good at it. i won the l.a. golden gloves when i was eighteen, you know. but when i heard about my mom, i just upped and left. what's the matter? you worried your brother's gonna come in and catch you enjoying yourself? no. elise, has he ever hurt you? no. well... sometimes, if i do stupid things, he'll lose his temper, but i know he does it for my own good. - who else lives with the two of you?

what excuse can i make? what do you want me to say, huh? i don't know. you'll think of something. tell her your car's broken down. use your imagination. say we fell in love with the place and decided to handcuff ourselves to the bed. shut up! cuff him, come on. - now give me the key. quick! - i'm trying. tell her something believable, or you know what'll happen. - hello! - oh! weren't you supposed to leave yesterday? oh, sorry i frightened you. - here, let me help with that. - no, no, no, leave it alone. you start interfering, before i know who i am, i'm out of a job. and i need the money. i've got a disabled husband. er... our flight was delayed. we had no place else to say, so we came back here... it's none of my business, but you are breaking your agreement, you know. why didn't you go and sleep in the, erm... you know... you know, the airport? - the lounge? - oh, i'll do that in a minute. i've only got one pair of hands, you know. i always work to a routine. hall, dining room, and then the lounge. or you could get me into a lot of trouble. i'm not one to nag. we even had trouble with the car, you know. it's a hire car. we never even made it to the airport. it got stuck - in the mud, and then we had to... - oh, look in here. what's all this on this carpet? it looks like blood. - how did it get here? - my husband hurt his knee. look, i'll clean it up. in fact, i'll clean up everything. you can go home, come back tomorrow... - i'll have it all cleaned up. - no, no, no. i'm not toing and froing just to suit in with your plans, my dear. i'll do what i can now, and the rest you can sort out with the owners... look! you really should go. the doctor said we should stay in quarantine. we've been very ill, it could be contagious. - we have chickenpox. - don't worry, dear. i've had it. you sure have. how'd you get this? it wasn't me, i hope? no. i slipped in the shower. caught it on the tap thing. really? you know, when i first saw you, i thought you were such an innocent little thing. - how wrong i was. - not complaining, are you? no, no, it's just, looks can be deceiving, huh? hey. don't go yet. - why not? - stay for a while. i wanna hold you. i don't want you to go yet. why? what do you mean, \\\"why\\\"? - well, we've finished, haven't we? - well, yeah, but... then i should go back. - what's up? what is this? - you want me again? well, yeah, but i'm not talkin' about sex, elise. shit, i never thought it'd be me saying this. - i wanna get to know you better. - i haven't got time. besides, i've gotta go now, or peter will go mad. hey, fuck peter, okay? what about us? i can imagine just how mad your peter can get. maybe i ought to go and see your brother. no, danny! listen, if he ever hurts you, i'll kill him. you hear me, elise? then you shall wear my colours. i'll take this to the fight tonight. you haven't forgotten, have you? - town hall, the championships? - seven-thirty. where the hell have you been? i was worried. i knew you'd forget. you asked me to buy some more vodka. took your time. well, it's sunday, isn't it? the shops are shut. i had to go to a pub and buy it. i had to wait until they opened. i think i'm very clever. maybe. what's all that muck on your face? trying to hook a local lad? no! i don't like it. go upstairs, get rid of it. peter! argh! peter! - i brought you these. - thanks. elise, we heard you screaming. did he hurt you? that was nothing. just peter playing one of his games. - god... - i mean, it's not right, elise. surely you know that? it's not natural. it is to me. he just really loves me. he can't show it with fine words, so he shows it with deeds instead. he just plays around, and punishes me when he thinks i deserve it. he punishes you with sex, elise. it's not right. given the choice of that and a good beating, i know which i'd rather have. - elise... - he just loves me too much sometimes. - where is he now? - asleep. he's been drinking. never could handle his drink. elise, listen to me. when you were out, he murdered someone. who? the woman who came to clean the house. he shot her through the head and dumped her off a cliff. i saw him do it. i know he'll stop killing! when we get away somewhere safe, he'll be different. he gets all... he... he gets all... what? strung out? he's a homicidal maniac, elise. you know, sometimes he cries and i have to tell him it's all right. maybe you're right. there is something wrong. but locking him up's not gonna help! - he killed our parents because of me. - no. - wanting to be with me! - no! he could see in them what he could become... elise, no! that's different. it's murder! he killed them so he wouldn't end up like they were. yeah, yeah, i can see the logic in that. he never wanted to be really bad like his parents, who get pissed off when they find out he's sleeping with his sister... - bryon, ssh! - so he shoots 'em. great idea! i had such a wonderful time with danny. now you say these things to me, and i don't know what to do! i want to go into town to see him tonight, but i can't. i... look, look, you get the car keys, we'll drive you into town, okay? - we can take you to danny now. - we can do it. i can never go! i can't! - please. - no, you know i can't. - no! elise, come back! - i can't! go away, danny. i've thought about us. it won't work! get away from me. peter and me, we have to be together, just like byron's story. we're linked together, like an old tragedy with the wind, and the sea, and our destinies. they're all linked, interwoven. there's no place for you. shouldn't be down here, ellie. not dressed like this. you'll freeze to death. i don't know what i'm doing here. but it feels like i belong here now. we'll find somewhere like this where we can be together. stop looking over our shoulders. somewhere full of tragedy and mystery. where souls linger forever, caught between the sand and the surf. don't go gettin' all melodramatic on me, ellie. not like one of your novels. i need you here with me. this is real life. take a good look. hmm, the face sort of looks familiar. don't know. maybe he just reminds me of somebody. what do you want him for? i'm surprised you haven't read about him. - i can't read, mate. - but you can see. it's not advisable to withhold information from the police, especially connected with a mass murderer like him. murderer? no. don't ring no bells with me. sorry, i can't help you, mate. we haven't heard back from forensics yet, but we're pretty sure we've got the vehicle they used. yeah, i... i know it's slow progress, sir, but he's been so elusive. yeah, i've just come off the phone from our men in the area. i may be grasping at straws, but they seem to think one of the fishermen they spoke to today recognised reece's photo. yeah. yeah. it could mean he's already left the country by boat. no, no other definite lead. no, sir. right. oh, shit. what are you doing? no-one'll mind if i take these books, will they? - what for? - my shop, of course. i thought i'd get packed and ready for the morning. yeah, we'll leave early. i'd better check on our hosts. you should go to bed. it's late. in a moment. i'll watch the storm for a while. is he dead? no. sleeping. think i'll stay here for a while. seems a shame to be leaving a horny little thing like you behind. peter? peter! elise, you didn't come! you didn't see me win. i'm a champion, see? you've got to get out of here! aw, i'm all cold and wet. you wouldn't throw me out into the storm, now, would ya? okay, we'll dry you off, then you've got to go. take your clothes off and i'll find something for you to wear. ellie, how about we both take our clothes off? we can't. where is that brother of yours? i ought to knock him out, too. - ssh! he's upstairs. - yeah? well, he won't know what's cookin' in the kitchen, then, will he? still with us? thought you were dead. smile! you're on candid camera! elise? wash all that filth away! between your legs, come on! - please, you won't kill him, will you? - all of it! please don't kill him, peter! get him out. get him out of every little crevice! he didn't mean to do it! it wasn't his fault. i asked him to come here! i did! hey, hey. ellie, don't lie to me. i've met scum like him before. please... when i think of what we do to scum like him inside, he'll wish he'd never been born! you're hurting me! please, peter, don't kill him! just... just lock him up somewhere till we've gone. please, peter! you go to bed early. leave him to me. janet farrell. you have? you sure? i've just this second checked it out, and everything seems to fit. it was some disabled guy who phoned. his wife does a cleaning job for the people who let this house called nowhere. great name, eh? anyway, we'd checked the house before, and there was a honeymoon couple renting it. an american couple. wonderful. this'll be a great boost for tourism. i can't see why you're so sure you've got the right place. i checked with the tour company, and the honeymooners were supposed to fly home yesterday, but they didn't turn up for their flight. and we've managed to get that fisherman to talk. reece approached him on friday, wanting a boat to take him out of the country. and the interesting thing is the wily old sod said he was with a foreign woman. american, he thought. good work, helen. i'll be with you in five minutes. i wanna be fully briefed. this is a very delicate situation. i'm on me way. good mornin'. sorry about that, i don't know what came over me. you do know why you're in these palatial surroundings, don't you? strung up like a dog! you crazy bastard. let me go! let you go? let a rapist go? i'll let you go down there. when i've finished. when i've had my fill! peter... please... let me in! it wasn't his fault! please don't hurt him anymore! please... she wanted me to. i didn't force her! \\\"oh, she was asking for it, milord.\\\" is that what you're telling me? please! you really can't go round stickin' your big stick into other people's little sisters without their big brothers gettin' a bit pissed off! please don't hurt him any more! it wasn't his fault! go back to the house, ellie! i invited him here! i wanted him inside me! i still want him! she's right! she wanted me! no. she's lyin'. you! you! you brainwashed her with your small-town talk and smarmy ways. i'll make sure you never rape another girl again. an eye for an eye. that's fair, isn't it?

(crowd clamoring) sire! this woman is a liar and a witch. but la dame blanche is a white witch, and i practice white magic. and with french money, we will unite the clans, and i will lead you all to the gates of london. and to glory. the prince is a canny, slippery man, yet can fool good men to believe he's god's chosen one. we have thwarted him all we can. we may find ourselves staring into the abyss awaiting us at the bottom of culloden moor. bring me home. - to scotland. - (sobbing) aye. scotland. sing me a song of a lass that is gone say, could that lass be i? merry of soul she sailed on a day over the sea to skye billow and breeze islands and seas mountains of rain and sun all that was good all that was fair all that was me is gone sing me a song of a lass that is gone say, could that lass be i? merry of soul she sailed on a day over the sea to skye api.opensubtitles.org is deprecated, please implement rest api from opensubtitles.com claire: we returned to heal in the peace of the scottish highlands. jamie's sister, jenny, and her husband, ian, had had another baby while we were in paris. their welcome and the daily routines of lallybroch worked like a tonic on our battered souls. we hoped we had done enough to stop the war. we began planning our future, but as a very prescient scot once observed, the best laid schemes of mice and men. rabbie: claire, claire! they're ready! look how big they are! they're giant! oh, my goodness, rabbie. so they are. can we eat them tonight? oh, i don't see why not. come on, let's go ask mrs. crook. a grand potato, if ever i saw one. ye've never seen one. not in fraser land. not till now. ye were right tellin' us to plant them, claire. 'tis a fine crop. i dinna see how ye'd ever grind them for parritch. i dinna believe ye grind them, mrs. crook. och, aye? what do ye do with 'em, then? fergus: you boil them. - eat them with salt. - aye. - butter is good, too. - claire: or roast them. or you can mash them with milk. oh, i dinna ken you could cook, sassenach. i'm not sure i can cook, but i can certainly boil a potato. mmm, then we shall have a feast. - (both chuckle) - (door opens) man: ye did well. wipe yer feet and take off yer filthy boots before ye tramp all over this rug. mrs. crook: come along, lads. you can help me scrub them clean. i ran into hector on the way up. got the post from him, eh? oh, jamie, here's one for you. (jamie speaking other language) louise. it's the bill for the seed. and one from aunt jocasta. good, we haven't heard from her in months. ian: now, did ye get the plowshare fixed? smitty says it's broken straight through. canna be re-forged. we'll have to hand-till until we can get a new one. i canna believe i've become a farmer. oh, three french novels and a book of poetry from paris. which one shall we read tonight? (jamie speaking other language) and what is it? \\\"dear cousin, so pleased. \\\"words cannot express my admiration for your boldness and courage. \\\"my prayers are with you.\\\" - stuart crest. - aye. it declares a stuart's divine right to the throne of britain, supported by the chieftains of the highland clans, signed by those pledging loyalty to charles stuart. \\\"mackinnon, oliphant, macdonald of glencoe. \\\"james alexander malcolm mackenzie fraser.\\\" jesus bloody christ, he's forged your signature. aye, he has. charles has landed in scotland and is gathering his army. jenny: this was published, distributed. the names on this are traitors to the crown. jamie. it's all coming to pass, isn't it? jacobite rising, culloden, the clearances. the destruction of all of this. so it would seem. we could go to ireland, or the colonies. what of ian and jenny? my nieces, nephews, our cousins? we can bring them with us. all of them? what of our tenants? leave them to the... the mercy of the british butchers if the culloden is lost? your name on that document brands you as a traitor to the british. and you will be hung as one if they catch you. we can't stay. we know what will happen if the jacobites lose the war. but... but what if they win? they don't. it's the verdict of history. have you given up trying to change the future, then, sassenach? well, after paris, haven't you? aye, paris was bitter disappointment. but you can change the future. you've proven that. thomas baxter lives because of you. paris was spared an outbreak of smallpox because of you. and louise de rohan will bear charles stuart's bairn because of you. you want to fight for prince charles? fight for our family. and for scotland. canna see any other way. can you? not one that we could live with. (sighs) they say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. well, i do not ken who they are, sassenach, but i'll wager, they have never traveled through time. (rumbling) so, with daniel wallace and duncan maclennan, ye should have 30 able-bodied men from lallybroch. good. murtagh, i'll need ye to bring the men to kingussie. claire and i will meet you there in two weeks, and we'll go together to join the prince at crieff. as ye say. and where will we be during these two weeks? uh, prince charles has dispatched me to enlist men and support from our kinsman, lord simon fraser of lovat. ye're going to see lord lovat? ask him to do ye a favor? ask him to help preserve his country and restore the rightful king to the throne. he does have a history of supporting the jacobites, ye ken. oh, aye, and the british and anyone else that will help him line his pockets and claim the title chief of clan fraser of lovat. a position he is entitled to and has held for over 20 years. you're defending the old buzzard, now? father must be birling in his grave. who is lord lovat? both: our grandsire. who we've laid eyes on but once in our lives, when he came to visit just after our mother died. father threw him out before he could cross the threshold. why? he tried to have our mother kidnapped and taken to the monach isles in order to prevent our father from marrying her. - there was some bad blood... - (scoffs) between lovat and the mackenzies. a situation i assume prince charles is unaware of? 'tis not only degrading for ye to crawl to that man and ask him for help. 'tis a fool's errand. the old fox does nothing that's not in his best interest and never without a price. no. no, what would be foolish, janet, would to let pride stand in the way of doing whatever i can to save lallybroch, scotland, and everything that we hold dear. we'll leave for beaufort castle first thing tomorrow. i havena been completely honest with ye about my family, sassenach. - what do you mean? - my father... he was a bastard. acknowledged by his father, lord lovat, but a bastard nonetheless. and your grandmother? lord lovat's kitchen maid. she raised my father at beaufort castle. i should've told ye before we wed. i'm sorry. it was cowardly of me. (exhales) jamie, you must know your father's parentage makes no difference to me. hmm. well, it should. (softly) it doesn't. - let's go to bed. - aye. (jamie muttering faintly) (jamie speaking other language) (jamie continues speaking other language) (door opens) the bairn couldna sleep, and neither could jamie. he thought they could keep each other company for a bit while ian and i slept. and he's trying to get back on my good side. (chuckles) did it work? it's a start. (speaking other language) jenny: ye can talk to a wee one in a way you canna talk to anyone else. ye can pour out yer heart to them without choosing your words or holding anything back at all. (speaking other language) jenny: and that's a comfort to the soul. (jamie speaking other language) it's the way we talk to them before they're born. ye know. (chuckles) yes. i know. jenny: the man has to wait until the child's born, and then they hold their bairn, (inhales deeply) and feel all the things that might be and all the things that might never be, and weep, not knowing which ones will come to pass. - take care of your fraser. - aye. (mutters) and you yours. jenny: take this. it brought ian back to me from france. (sniffles) ye gave ian a token when we went to france, and no' me? and him not even your betrothed at the time. (shakily) don't make me regret giving it to ye now. if ye don't come back, brother, i'll never forgive ye. never is a very long time. i know. just where do ye think ye're going? (scoffs) well, with milord. (chuckles) ye're too young to fight, laddie. ye'll bide here wi' us. you can help rabbie in the stables till milord returns. but i belong with you. is that not what you told me, milady, that i will always have a home with you? yes, of course. - but sometimes, it's... - jamie: he's right. his place is no' here without us, nor in france on his own. bring him with ye, murtagh, when ye come with the men. aye. (sighs) if i havena killed him first. dinna fash, claire. we'll keep him well away from the battle. the outcome is in yer hands, laddie. a good soldier must learn to obey his commanding officer, as well as his general. (speaking other language) (sighs) take care of each other. and watch out for my grandsire. i will. bye, jenny. (sighs) claire: during our ride to beaufort castle, jamie filled me in on what he knew of his grandfather. over the last 50 years, lord simon fraser of lovat had been alternately loyal to both the exiled king james and the monarchs sitting on the british throne. his personal life was equally infamous. aside from numerous extramarital dalliances, lord lovat had had three wives, two of them acquired by nefarious means. lord lovat will be with you shortly. (door closes) i do wish we'd had a chance to freshen up a bit before meeting your grandfather. dinna fash, sassenach. you look bonny, though ye do have a few teasel heads in your hair. man: leave 'em. they suit her. colum. i arrived this morning, myself. i saw ye enter the courtyard from the window. what are ye doing here? well, i'm here to discuss a response to the rebellion with lord lovat, as i assume you are. war. it makes for strange bedfellows. i'm pleased to see that ye're well. you'll have to excuse me if i find that hard to believe. the witch trial, colum. ye seem to be implying that i, uh... i had something to do with your involvement in that. it is my impression that ye were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. claire: yes, i was. thanks to a message from your kitchen maid, laoghaire, who just happened to know the exact time and place of the arrest. a gross overstepping of her place, for which i had her beaten. i would've thrown her out of leoch, but her grandmother, mrs. fitz, persuaded me she could keep the girl in check. is dougal with ye? no. it became clear that it was best for the clan that my brother remain at his own estate. surely dougal would be the one leading clan mackenzie in fighting for king james? i'd forgotten what a curious mind you have, lass. (door slams) so the rumor is true. the grandson of lord simon fraser of lovat has bound himself to a sassenach. but i suppose ye are yer father's son, after all. who's to expect the boy to have more sense choosing a wife than did the bastard who made him? at least i had no need to take a wife by means of rape or trickery. (laughs) (chuckles) no' as serious as yer father. good. enough breath wasted on a woman. leave us. it's time to talk politics with my grandson and my rival. (door opens and closes) claire: while jamie's meeting dragged on, i took the opportunity to look over the place lord lovat called home. (indistinct conversations) laoghaire: mistress fraser? i've been looking for ye since i heard you were here. laoghaire. did the laird not tell ye i was with him? - no. - my grandmother sent me along to wash his laundry and help wherever i'm needed. i wanted to find ye, though, because... (sighs) i need to tell you. i am changed. and i am sorry beyond measure for the horrible wrong i did to ye. my grandmother has made me see i canna be right with god until i make amends (inhales deeply) for the pain my evil actions have caused. i believe it is god brought us together here so i could do so. god? you speak of god? how often have i thought about what i would do whenever i saw you again? i have fantasized all manner of violent acts that i would subject you to. to all of them, ending with lighting the pyre beneath your feet and dancing on your ashes as you promised to dance on mine. (sobbing) i don't hate you, laoghaire. i pity you. the dark places you must've inhabited in the hopes of getting something that you'll never have. as for getting right with god, you'll just have to find another way (sobs) 'cause i can't help you. maybe god did bring us together. oh, somehow, i... i feel lighter. (scoffs) ye're more forgiving than i am, sassenach. i wouldna give that brazen besom the time of day. perhaps. so, will i be allowed to join you at dinner tonight? oh, aye. aye, my grandsire's no' opposed to a bit of decoration at the dinner table. (scoffs) as long as that decoration doesna speak. (sighs) aye. just like that. now, come along. (sighs) (indistinct chatter) jamie: every man here knows that to most british, all highlanders, no matter their allegiance, we're all the same. savage dogs better put down than let live. and after three uprisings, the british army will be motivated to put us down for good. to save our clans, our country, our very way of life, we must band together under the true king, king james. fight. and we must win. (inhales deeply) we're very fortunate to have among us such a close confidant of the prince. isn't that so, lovat? we're lucky to have somebody to give us an inside view of this holy rebellion. aye, but i dinna know how holy it is. (men murmuring and chuckling) so can you tell us, then, nephew, how much support have the french agreed to give? (chuckles) the french have already supported us, colum, by engaging the british army in flanders, reducing the troops remaining here at home. the prince is certain the french will want to press the advantage, send men and artillery to support the jacobites. oh, so... so the french have not yet committed to prince charles? always an unreliable ally, the french. (laughter and murmuring) we will welcome the french support when it comes, but we dinna need it. the jacobite army is already 1,000 men strong in crieff. macdonalds, camerons, stuarts, and grants, and more joining every day while the majority of the british army remains on the continent licking their wounds. (indistinct chatter) i have heard the british have offered \\u00e2\\u00a330,000 for the capture of prince charles. meaning what? meaning the british see prince charles as a real threat. ye'll join us then, cousin? lord lovat: perhaps the british know, as the rest of us do, how many cullions there are amongst the campbells and the camerons, men who would sell their own grandmothers for half that amount. - man: aye. - (men murmuring) - well, i... - for \\u00e2\\u00a330,000, the british could end this rebellion before it even starts. a fair sight less than it would cost them to wage a war. (chuckles awkwardly) i hadn't considered that. then sit down, ye mealy-mouthed wee smout, and dinna speak again until ye have considered what ye're about to say. bring us more wine, my lovely, and a glass of milk for my boy. (laughter) enough war talk tonight. (indistinct chatter) (sighs) you know, i got the impression that colum was trying to use you to convince lord lovat not to join the rebellion. aye. (sighs) jamie: the first jacobite rebellions failed, and colum will never support another. he wants lovat's clan to stay neutral with the mackenzies, knowing that the smaller clans will follow, and the rebellion will collapse before it ever gets started. claire: well, why doesn't colum just speak to him directly? because my grandsire doesna trust my uncle. (door closes) using me is a much more effective strategy. i need to speak to lovat on my own, without colum leading me to make his arguments for him. it's a pity young simon is such a spineless creature. i believe he could influence his father's decision if he took a strong stance for our side. the man has nothing but contempt for the poor boy. ah, he's just trying to toughen him up, make him a viable successor to lead clan fraser of lovat. my grandsire had the perfect opportunity to say no to us tonight, but he didn't. perhaps jenny was right. he wants something in exchange. (door opens) lord lovat: do ye think ye can toy with me? (gasps) ye're keeping something from me, ye old hag, and i'm no' havin' it. (sobbing) (door closes) (crying) are you all right? here, let me help you. oh... thank you, mistress. i'm claire. maisri. lord lovat's seer. - (distant clatter) - oh... wait. i'll wager yer father painted a black portrait of my character. he said very little about ye. he chose that mackenzie whore... and i'll ask ye to keep a civil tongue when you speak of my mother! over me, his father, twice. first when i told him not to marry her... and yer kidnapping attempt failed. second time, she was dead and buried. i was willing to forgive him, make him my successor, despite the fact he was a bastard. and he chose her memory and that place... lallybroch. over me. is it true? what? that you've no' pledged yer fealty to colum mackenzie? that's what ye're after, is it? my fealty to you in exchange for sending aid to prince charles? (chuckles) to be honest, i'm more interested in what goes with it. (scoffs softly) what need have ye of lallybroch? the tenants' rents would probably make no difference to a place like this. what i do with that damnable place would be no concern of yers. i'm yer grandsire and head of your clan, after all. i demand my due. if i wouldna give my pledge to colum, who i know to be kin, then what sort of fool would i be to give it to an old twister that may or may not share my blood? you made free with yer housemaids. perhaps others did, too. (laughing) oh, christ, laddie! (chokes and coughs) (inhales deeply) implying yer grandmother's a whore to keep what you want? oh, ye're my kin, all right. would that my son had half yer mettle... jamie: i'll give ye the same pledge i gave colum. my help and goodwill, my obedience to yer word, so long as my feet rest on lovat soil. did ye no' hear me? it's yer father's precious estate i'm after. if ye'll no' give me lallybroch in exchange for men for prince charles, how about this? lallybroch for yer wife's honor. (chuckles) go ahead. try to ravish my wife. and after she's done with ye, i'll send in the maid to sweep up yer remains. not i, lad, though i've taken my pleasure with worse. your grandmother comes to mind. but there are many men in beaufort castle who'd be of a mind to put your sassenach wench to the only use she's good for. ye canna guard her night and day. no. i needn't worry, grandsire. my wife's a rare woman. ye ken. a wise woman. la dame blanche. \\\"the white lady.\\\" the sassenach? a witch? aye, it's true. the man that takes her in unholy embrace will have his privates blasted, like a frostbitten apple. and his soul will burn forever in hell. (glass shatters) like that. jamie: my grandsire has a great respect for the supernatural. no' for anything else, but ye should take care the next few days if i'm no' here. well, he didn't seem that frightened of that poor woman when he tossed her out into the corridor. ah, maisri's but a seer. she's not a white lady, like my wife. but she did know something she wasna telling him. your grandfather really is a brute, isn't he? aye. a brute that may soon own my ancestral home. you can't be seriously thinking about giving him what he wants? well, the prince will hardly put much stock in my abilities to lead men or wage war if i'm not even able to persuade my own grandsire to support our cause. well, what about young simon? what if we persuade him to stand up to his father, declare his support for the rebellion? aye. aye, then lovat may send his men if only to protect his heir, but after that scene last night, it'll take more time than we have to give the boy the confidence he needs to truly defy his father. perhaps it depends on what we use to boost his confidence. (sniffles) (sighs) (sniffing) claire: is that jamie's shirt? i've done nothing to it. didn't mean to imply that you had. i have changed, ye ken. i have repented and asked god's forgiveness, and it was working. i thought he brought you both here to help me, but it was to test me. in the great hall, jamie didn't even see me. 'twas like i didna exist. if ye willna avenge yerself, ye must leave me be. perhaps i could find my way to forgive you. - but jamie... - hail mary, full of grace. jamie will never love you, laoghaire. but there might be a way to earn his forgiveness. for him to think of you without rancor. and why would you want him to do that? (whispers) because we need lord lovat to send his men and weapons to fight for prince charles, and we believe he might do this if young simon stood up to him and took jamie's side. and what is that to do with me? young simon is infatuated with you. you could use that to help persuade him. oh, no. i'll not sink further into the pit of depravity. i'll not give up my maidenhead for you! no one is asking you to give up anything. besides, it's not for me. it's for jamie. a woman has more to offer a man than her body. when a man is in love, he craves his beloved's approval. he wishes to please her, and to look heroic in her eyes. and if i do whatever it is ye have in mind, ye'll speak to jamie on my behalf? yes. i canna tell you how i know, but i do. you must believe me. the only way to survive is to fight and win. and we need the weapons and men to do so. remaining neutral will be seen as treason by whatever side wins. ye know? ye just know? ye sound like a madman! history guides my course in this matter. history! not wild beliefs and wishful thinking. the other risings, they failed because there was no outside support, and that support does not exist now. if we do not send men to fight, this rebellion will melt away. and when that happens, we will be left alone, as we were in the past. lord lovat. (chuckles) he would see that, too, if only the vengeful prize of lallybroch was not dangling in front of his eyes. and he would agree to neutrality. jamie, ye were always headstrong, but ye were never reckless with the lives of others. for yer sake, and for the sake of all you hold dear, do not make this bargain with that man. do not trade your home for a war ye canna win. will ye promise me that? i promise you, uncle. i promise you, i will do what i must to save those things you and i hold most dear. - (door opens) - (sighs) (door closes) so nice of you to volunteer to show me the chapel, master lovat. i believe it was yer idea. it's so peaceful here. do you plan to do much when you become laird? simon: i've no' given it much thought. - my father's still a vigorous man. - hmm. some have speculated he's immortal. and as ye may have noticed, he doesn't have much respect for me. my husband confided in me that his father sometimes exposed him to public scorn, to make him a better leader of men. oh, laoghaire. (chuckles) i hope we're not disturbing you. oh, no, milady. just collecting some mushrooms for the cook. i'd like a few private moments in the chapel. do you mind waiting here for me? oh, well, if mistress laoghaire wouldn't prefer her solitude... (chuckles) oh, no, i'd welcome the company. it's a dreich day. aye. do you like mushrooms? not much, no. i like poetry. so do i. \\\"though hurricanes rise and rise every wind \\\"they'll ne'er make a tempest like that in my mind \\\"though loudest of thunder on louder waves roar \\\"that's naething like leaving my love on the shore - \\\"to leave thee...\\\" - perhaps you'd like to sit down on the tree. - maisri. - (gasps) it's claire fraser. we met in the corridor. lord lovat's tenants do not like someone like me in the house of god. this is the only place where my mind goes quiet. i don't know why. they say you are a \\\"white lady.\\\" yes, they do say that. what brings you into a church, then? it was cold outside. i'm glad to see that you're doing all right. lord lovat was so rough with you the other day. his lordship is not an easy master. he asks what i see and beats me when i tell him things that displease him. does it always come to pass, the things that you see? mostly, aye. although sometimes an action can change things. when i still lived in the village, i saw lachlan gibbons' daughter's man wrapped in seaweed, and the eels stirring beneath his shirt. i told lachlan what i'd seen, and he went straight away and stove a hole in the boy's boat. (gasps) lord, there was a stramash, a right to-do. but when the great storm came the next week, three men were drowned, and that boy was safe at home, still mending his boat. what did you see right before lord lovat threw you out? i promise, i won't tell him that you told me. he was standing there before the fire in his study, but it was daylight. a man stood behind him, still as a tree, his face covered in black. and across his lordship's face, there fell the shadow of an ax. but if you told him, he could change his behavior, perhaps change the outcome. aye. or he might just kill the messenger. laoghaire: mistress claire, where are ye? mistress claire? i'll be right there! oh. (sighs) where is young simon? he ran off like a feart wee mouse. - what did you do? - everything ye said. i flattered him. i told him how much i admired a man who made decisions, who thought for himself. i gave him a keek down the front of my dress, i... i told you it wasn't about sex. no wonder he ran off. well, other than reciting verse, he wasna doing much to hold up his end of the conversation. i tried! (thunder rumbling) (indistinct chatter) - jamie? - (rain pattering) jamie: aye. oh, i thought i'd find you in here. more and more these days, i think i'd prefer to be a beast. no luck with colum, then? no. and you, with young simon? no. i did find out what maisri wouldn't tell lord lovat, though. aye? she saw his death at the hands of an executioner. a traitor's death. i dinna suppose she mentioned if the executioner was in the employ of king george or king james? no, i'm afraid not. i promised colum i'd do what i had to, to save the highlanders. so i must. jamie, it's too much. let's just go to prince charles with the men from lallybroch. i canna go to the prince a failure. it seems i canna get the men from lovat without giving him my land. so, unless yer planning on declaring yerself a visitor from the future and describing what will happen if we dinna fight and win, then i dinna see i have much choice. (thunder rumbles) i have had my secretary prepare a neutrality pact between the frasers of lovat and the mackenzies of leoch. i have also had him prepare a deed of sasine for lallybroch estate. assigning the property to me. sign it, and ye'll have yer men for king james. don't sign it, and i'll agree to neutrality with mackenzie here. which will it be? ye'll let this boy decide the fate of clan lovat? he's not even yer recognized heir. i have made this decision. the boy is but an obstacle in my way. what will it be, obstacle? dinna be a fool, jamie. (people murmuring) i do this to ensure the future of my family and people. (clangs loudly) (claire gasps) (gasps) what are ye staring at? claire? (breathing shakily) claire: no! it's another vision. - claire. - leave her be! do no' give me orders about my own wife! - claire! claire, claire. - (gasping) what did she see? - jamie! - what did ye see, witch? stay back! oh, lovat. can you not see this for the pretense that it is? pretense? you know that she was tried as a witch by those that dinna understand the difference between black magic and the power of the old ones. what did she see? you don't need to answer him, claire. she will if she wants to walk out of this room. no, it's all right, jamie. (thunder rumbling) i saw you standing in bright sunlight. there was a man behind you. he was wearing a black hood, (shakily) shadow of an ax across your face! whose man? whose executioner? king james or king george? (gasping) i... i don't remember. the ground was covered in white roses. the symbol of the jacobites! - no, no. - (men murmuring) lord lovat: witch! i'll cut out yer tongue! how dare you thwart me, boy. you and mackenzie are fearful old men. and you're wrong. my cousin is right. it's our duty to stand up for our country and our kinsmen. i will fight for king james. i will fight to change the white lady's vision even if ye will not. (knife sheathes) the frasers of lovat will stand with the mackenzies of leoch. we will remain neutral in the war. (chuckles) i wish ye luck, my boy. come, mackenzie, let's drink to our newly formed alliance. (men murmuring) (speaking other language) i'm ready. ye did well, young simon. i'm proud to be yer kinsman. and i'll be proud to fight by yer side. i'll wait for ye outside the gate. aye. so we go to the prince empty-handed. but at least we were able to save lallybroch. aye. go back to yer home and yer family. i told you, uncle, i canna do that. can you not convince him to listen to reason and go home? you've known him longer than i have. what do you think? i think it's a blessing that his mother didn't live to see what a reckless fool she spawned. (sniffs) give me your hand. (sighs) (grunts) (speaking other language) we must away as well, claire. i need to be in kingussie by the end of the week. wait. before we go, there's something that i need you to do for me. aye. say thank you to laoghaire. \\\"thank you\\\"? for what? not trying to have you arrested in the last few days? please. do it for me. i'll explain it all later. (thunder rumbles) aye. (clears throat) i, uh... i'm told to thank ye. for what, i dinna ken, but... thank you, laoghaire. i hope one day i can also earn yer forgiveness, jamie. (softly) and yer love. let's go. (man muttering) who are they? my father's men. man: hup, come on. go. go on. come. don't sit there gaping at me, ye glaiket sumph! go see to yer men! turning that one into a soldier will be a greater feat than beating the british. (laughs) what vision do ye have for me now, white lady? i don't understand. now it will seem my grandsire has sent his heir to fight. the stuarts will credit lovat with supporting king james, should they win. they canna execute me for treason. but what about the neutrality agreement? i trust old colum mackenzie is right. and that will protect me if the british should win. what will you say about your son fighting for the jacobites? he's his own man, that one. ye saw it yourself last night. persuaded others to follow. i thank ye, white lady. i couldna have got it all without ye. ye didna get lallybroch. not yet. aye. come on! please, tell me i'm nothing like him, sassenach. i'm afraid i have seen a similarly devious turn of mind. i might have to rethink our agreement not to lie to one another. - (chuckles) - (clicks tongue) claire: as we put distance between ourselves and jamie's loathsome grandfather, my heart lightened. we had lovat's men now. jamie would have the prince's favor and at least the opportunity to steer the rebellion to victory. maisri had said we could change the future. perhaps we already had. please rate this subtitle at www.osdb.link/bj3sh help other users to choose the best subtitles\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"chunks\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"embeddings\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
